A few weeks ago, it was time for me. True to the motto: Courage for new things!
My old cell phone was slowly giving up its ghost and I was looking for something new.
I chose the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.
My husband has been using iPhones for a long time, but so far I've only had Android phones.
As I said, I ordered the 14 Pro Max a few weeks ago and I have to tell you, I'm really impressed. Of course, the changeover took a bit of getting used to, but I got used to the system very quickly.
When the cell phone arrived, I was of course able to insert my old SIM card and get started right away.
I would like to share a very little bit of my life with you, which has to do directly with my cell phone.
In fact, I have an unusual hobby.
I've loved mountaineering ever since I was little and have expanded it more and more.
I now climb the highest feasible mountains on earth, often all alone.
From some peaks, I even jump down into the valley, of course with a special parachute.
My new iPhone from Apple is particularly suitable for this particular hobby. The camera is particularly important to me. The innovative 48 MP main camera with the quad pixel sensor not only takes great pictures, but also fantastic videos. Even when I climb the mountains, I take countless pictures and videos of the surrounding area.
The videos of me jumping off the mountains and freefalling are simply indescribable.
My old cameras often wobbled so much that the movies simply became very bad. However, the iPhone 14 Pro has a very high standard, which is also used by the film industry (4K HDR at 24 FPS). The action mode really ensures a smooth shot, which my friends love to watch.
Since I'm on the subject of the camera: the camera has four times higher resolution and what fascinates me in particular is that the camera simply takes super good pictures even in very little light.
Because it often happens that I find myself on some mountains even at night. Then of course I particularly like to take beautiful pictures at dusk.
Since I'm currently on the subject of spending the night on the mountain: When I'm lying in my igloo at night, I love to watch my videos or even downloaded videos.
The battery is simply unbeatable, as it can play back up to 29 hours of videos.
Of course, I always have a small power bank with me, but it's actually only for emergencies.
Speaking of emergencies, I was particularly impressed by the fact that the iPhone has several safety features that might save my life in an emergency.
Sometimes I don't have cell phone reception, which could cost me my life in an emergency, such as a fall or serious illness. The Apple iPhone 14 pro has a very special security feature. In an emergency, this safety feature passes on an SOS emergency call via satellite via text message, even without network reception.
I also find accident detection very useful. I work as an emergency counselor and know how quickly a serious car accident can happen and sometimes you no longer have the opportunity to call for help in the event of a serious accident. But the cell phone system recognizes a serious car accident and calls emergency services if you can't do it yourself anymore.
I told you that it is my first Apple iPhone and that I am sometimes a bit unsure of how to use it, especially when I can't ask my husband.
Fortunately, I have the Apple Care package for that.
With it, I have a great 24 hour support service.
A repair in case of accidental damage is also included in the package.
The advantage that it is also protected from dust and moisture is of course beneficial to me when hiking.
Because it is often very dusty on the mountains and sometimes the rain comes faster than I had hoped.
And I have to admit that a few years ago I only had the chance to land in a lake while jumping. My old cell phone broke down due to water damage back then.
But with the Apple iPhone, I have the chance that it will survive such an action, as it should survive well even at a depth of six meters for 30 minutes.
Another advantage of this mobile phone is that I can do many things at the same time and the mobile phone overlays several actions.
Since I am a very nature-loving person, I think it's super good that Apple makes the promise that they will develop all products CO2 neutral by 2030.
I also have a very good feeling about Apple when it comes to data protection, as they promise to handle my data sensitively.
I find the dimensions of 0.78*7.76*16.07 cm and the weight of 240 g very practical, because the large display allows me to do how many things I can do with a great mobile phone.
The large battery capacity also speaks in favour of the mobile phone.
I believe that I have one of the most technologically advanced cell phones, which takes really great pictures and videos and simply makes my life easier and above all more beautiful.
The only thing I find a shame is that a charger is no longer included in the package.
I know that from my other old man, of course.
That's why I ordered a USB-C power adapter right away, which allows me to charge my new mobile phone very quickly.

A friend tells me that she always has problems saving the data, as you can no longer use an SD card. She says she has to pay something for the cloud first before she can save the data.
But so far I still have a lot of the 256 GB storage space available.
But I'm sure they're also used up quickly, due to my many activities.

Great device, which I can only recommend.
After using an iPhone 12 Pro Max from fall 2020, where the storage capacity is slowly running out of storage and I find the video improvements since the iPhone 13 Pro interesting, it is now time for a new iPhone.
The iPhone 14 Pro Max is once again manufactured to a very high quality and continues to have an excellent design since the iPhone 12, which is reminiscent of generations 4 to iPhone 5S.

The most important new features for me:
-Main camera significantly improved with up to 48 megapixels! However, in everyday life, only 12 megapixels and therefore hardly any difference in the size of the files. Good, because if you want to make full use of more pixels, you can switch to RAW (lots of editing potential, but huge files), but the quality of normal photos is simply improved. 
The focal length is now 24mm, i.e. slightly more wide angle (13 Pro: 26mm).
-Ultra wide-angle camera improved, should also be better for macro shots
-2x zoom back: As with the iPhone XS, you can now use 2x zoom optically again - an image section of the main camera instead of your own lens. Disadvantage: Probably lower quality in more difficult light than with 3x camera
Super Retina XDR display: The display is said to have improved even further. It seems extremely brilliant and sharp. In bright environments, it should even offer up to 2000 nits of brightness, meaning it should still be bright enough even in strong sunlight (up to twice as bright as previous iPhones). However, in a warm environment and simultaneous charging via power bank, etc., the display may dim and no longer offer full brightness, which I found problematic with the 12 Pro Max and has not yet been able to assess it with the 14 Pro Max.
-New processor or chip with probably a bit more performance, compared to the normal iPhone 14, which still comes with the processor from the previous year (only 1 more graphics core can be used in a normal iPhone 14, as with the 13 Pro).
-Always-On Display: As the name suggests, the display can stay on permanently and display energy-saving information at a low frame refresh rate. Can be very handy on a charging stand at a desk, for example... If you turn the iPhone around or put it in your pocket, the display should still switch off completely.
-Dynamic Island: Instead of the previous front camera and face recognition indentation at the top of the display, there is now a smaller, separate area that also integrates the display area all around to display information such as music playback, etc. A nice gimmick that is currently only reserved for the 14 Pro series.
-Cinema mode (for video recording) further improved and 4K

advantages compared to older devices (for anyone considering switching over):
-LiDAR scanner (since 12 Pro): future-proof -a big advantage for photography and filming in low light, improves the camera's auto-focus. In addition, there will probably be more and more AR applications, etc., which can make use of the new scanner.
-Ultra-wide-angle camera in addition compared to iPhone XS or older
-telephoto lens with 3x “zoom” compared to the iPhone 12 Pro (Max) (2.5x zoom) or only 2x “zoom” for iPhone XS or older
- photo quality in low light is significantly improved compared to older iPhones (generation XS and downwards) I find the difference gigantic, especially when shooting video at dusk... a lot improved since the iPhone 12.
-Sensor-stabilized camera in the 14 Pro Max — i.e. even better protection against shaking and advantages for video recordings. A big advantage over older generations before iPhone 12
action mode: A significant improvement for video recordings in motion, since iPhone 13 Pro (Max), can sometimes save a gimbal... but not at full resolution.
-Up to 1 TB capacity available since the iPhone 13 Pro (Max)
Apple ProRAW photo support (since iPhone 12 Pro). You can do more with the photos in post-processing (adjust colors, etc.), but a significantly larger memory size. Of course, it can be switched over
-ProRes and Dolby Vision HDR Video: Can be activated to record extremely high-quality, easy-to-edit videos, e.g. ideal for users who then want to edit in Final Cut Pro, etc... Of course, correspondingly high memory requirements. Available since iPhone 13 Pro or 12 Pro with Dolby Vision HDR.
-6 GB memory (RAM) - no progress compared to the predecessors since iPhone 12, but compared to older iPhones (before 12) or non-Pro models.
-long time updates: Compared to most Android devices, much longer support for new operating system versions with many new features and even security updates.
-iOS is constantly evolving and brings significant new features every year, even for old devices.
-Good water protection (after IP 68) - a significant improvement over previous iPhone 12
-5G support: Anyone who still uses iPhones before the 12th generation will also get an interesting improvement here
- battery life in Max makes a good impression on me. Quite a bit better than in the normal Pro version... so far I could hardly notice any differences compared to older Max models.
-MagSafe: magnetic system for connecting Qi chargers and other accessories to the back, installed since the iPhone 12. For 2 years, more and more useful MagSafe accessories have appeared, such as car holders, stands, wallets and much more...
-a slightly larger display than slightly older predecessor models (11 Pro Max, XS Max) - but also slightly larger housing

Disadvantages:
-Not yet the latest WLAN standard like 6E, still the same maximum Speed and the same standard as for years, therefore not as future-proof -
Unfortunately, ever new case sizes - old cases no longer fit... (MagSafe accessories such as wallets or stands are compatible with all iPhones over 12 though)
-No headphone jack, as has been the case since the iPhone 7. Cable headphones/headsets However, they can simply be plugged into a jack adapter via Lightning, or accessories can be connected directly with a Lightning plug (e.g. Apple EarPods).
-Face ID compared to devices with a home button: Sometimes unlocking with a fingerprint sensor would be more practical if the iPhone is lying flat on a table, for example. Apple has integrated this into the side button on the iPad Air. I would find it very desirable in addition to Face ID.
-No power supply/charger included since iPhone 12. For environmental reasons, the resulting smaller packaging is certainly an advantage. And many users already have enough chargers, but not everyone. But there are also many very cheap 18W or 20W USB-C power supplies that charge at least almost as fast as the original.
-iPhone prices in the EU have unfortunately risen significantly

Neutral:
-Hardly any improvement in the telephoto camera, still no more than 3x “zoom” or more telephoto focal length. In some cases, the competition offers significantly more... The quality is said to have improved only in low light, but presumably only via software.
-Lightning plug: I still think the Lightning connector on the iPhones is technically very good - the cables hold very well and the plug is pretty robust. Even multiple crashes on some iPhones directly onto the plug have not caused me any damage so far. USB C seems a bit more vulnerable to me and the connectors also need a little more space.
On the other hand, there are many more accessories for USB C, such as docks and adapters - unfortunately, the choice for Lightning is more limited. But I don't think that's so important on a smartphone, I find USB C more important with the iPad. Adapters to USB and SD card readers are also available for Lightning, among others.

Conclusion: In
my opinion, the iPhone 14 Pro Max is definitely the most technically advanced smartphone on the market right now. The Max version probably no longer has any technical advantages over the normal Pro, except for a larger battery in addition to the display.

In any case, I see the iPhone 14 Pro (Max) as an ideal choice for photographers and videographers. I find the video quality great and for many photo tasks it is completely sufficient if no smartphone can still replace full-frame DSLR/DSLM cameras.

For users of older models:
Anyone who still uses an iPhone 12 Pro (Max) will certainly appreciate significant camera advances; the difference from 13 Pro (Max) shouldn't be particularly great.
In my opinion, the speed of use has only improved slightly in recent years and even an 11 Pro or 12 Pro (Max) can keep up very well with most everyday tasks, I find even an XS Max fast enough - even for slightly more demanding users.
Cons: First of all, this device has very bad ergonomics because it's just bit too heavy. I'm angry at myself I didn't predicted that before I ordered. I did check the device at local stores, and it felt just fine, but if I hold this heavy phone longer in my hands, it's just painful, and my pinky hurts - supporting this 240g device is not that easy. And if you add some case and screen protector then it's more than 240g.

2nd ergonomics issue is the dynamic island. So we have it, and above dynamic island there is ALWAYS some minimal space between top of the screen, and that space is NEVER used. To be honest I liked notch more, and the only reason for dynamic island are nice animations... but no real benefit apart from that. Yes, it's interactive, you can touch it, i will show you some of the information like incoming call etc, but it's not a killer feature. It's rather waste of energy for development.

Another issues is very painful migration if you switch from Android phone. Call history is not copied. Also, messages could be copied, but because of bug those copied messages are not indexed. It means that search functionality in messages app will not work with your old, migrated text messages. Fortunately there is some workaround, that you can force re-indexing of all messages, but this is something Apple should fix long time ago...

Speaking of Messages app. Both Messages and dialer look really dated and limited. Those are way less functional than stock OneUI apps. Also, level of UI refinement is not the same. It's bit surprising for me, because I heard many times that Apple products have perfect and well-though UI...

Pros: Screen is bright, sharp and has beautiful deep colors. Call quality is superb. Build quality is superb, that "premium feel" is there.
I am absolutely amazed by the iPhone 14 Pro Max! This smartphone exceeded my expectations in many ways. The 48-megapixel main camera ensures breath-taking photos and videos that feature impressive levels of detail and color fidelity. Whether in daylight or in difficult lighting conditions, the camera always delivers first-class results.

The iPhone 14 Pro Max's battery is really impressive. I can easily get through the whole day without having to worry about an empty battery. Both when surfing the Internet, playing videos or using sophisticated apps, the battery lasts an astonishingly long time.

The iPhone 14 Pro Max's display is simply fantastic. The color reproduction is vivid and razor-sharp, and the size of the screen allows me to immerse myself in my content. Regardless of whether I'm watching movies, playing games or looking at photos, the display is convincing across the board.

The design of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is simply elegant. The smooth glass back and high-quality metal frame give the device an aesthetic touch. The smartphone is comfortable to hold and feels robust. The workmanship is first-class and gives a feeling of longevity.

The performance of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is simply outstanding. Thanks to the powerful processor and optimized software, everything runs smoothly and quickly. Whether it's multitasking, opening demanding apps, or running graphic-intensive games, the iPhone 14 Pro Max does it all with ease.

Overall, I am completely impressed by this smartphone. The iPhone 14 Pro Max offers an impressive camera, an outstanding battery, a great display, a classy appearance and high-quality workmanship. It is definitely worth the price and meets all my expectations for a top-end smartphone. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a premium phone.
The iPhone 14 Pro Max is undoubtedly a masterpiece of modern technology. The design is breathtaking - the premium materials and sleek finish make it a real gem.
The camera quality is exceptional. The clarity and color reproduction are really impressive, and thanks to the Pro camera settings, it's easier than ever to create professional-looking photos and videos.
As far as performance is concerned, the iPhone 14 Pro Max is outstanding. The speed and responsiveness are unbeatable, and the battery life is remarkably long, which means you can be productive all day without having to worry about charging.
The user experience, which has been improved by the new iOS, is as smooth and intuitive as ever. It also offers a wide range of apps and services that make life easier.
The iPhone 14 Pro Max is undoubtedly the best iPhone Apple has brought to market so far. It's an expensive device, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny. This iPhone sets the standard for future smartphones. I would highly recommend it.
The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is Apple's latest flagship smartphone and offers a wide range of features that make it one of the best smartphones on the market. With 256 GB of internal storage, this device has more than enough space for all your photos, videos, and apps.

The iPhone 14 Pro Max features a 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display that offers an incredible 2778 x 1284 pixel resolution. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures a smooth and responsive experience when scrolling or gaming.

The iPhone 14 Pro Max features a triple camera with 12-megapixel wide-angle, ultra-wide-angle and telephoto lens, which offers impressive image quality and a wide range of features, including night vision mode, deep fusion and Smart HDR 4.0.

This device also has improved battery life, providing up to 28 hours of talk time and 95 hours of music playback. It also supports 5G networks, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 and is equipped with the latest A16 Bionic chip, which ensures fast and responsive work.

In summary, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is an impressive smartphone that offers a wide range of features. With a large internal memory, an impressive display, a powerful camera and improved battery life, this device is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful smartphone.
Man, oh man, what a good quality. My expectations were even exceeded. Everything fits and is right all around. Had a Huawei before, which also means a certain period of changeover. The photo performance of the Huawei was also very good, the iPhone comes with it. Above all, the iPhone helps me make calls, as conversations are now transferred from the iPhone to the hearing aids via Bluetooth in excellent voice quality. Well, the price is also huge, of course, but so far I haven't regretted the purchase and there is also a lot of performance behind it. Anyone who can do it financially should buy it.
I have treated myself to the new iPhone 14 Pro Max and am 🤩 - once Apple, always Apple ‼️ I managed
the registration/process all by myself - actually a tech nerd - including bank apps etc...

I'm referring here to my iPhone 13 Pro Max review (https://www.amazon.de/gp/customer-reviews/RJSH8YJZQ0YPD) or a comparison to the predecessor in general.

Something has happened “in theory” to the predecessor, but do you notice anything about it in everyday life!? I was very satisfied with my 13 Pro Max, so it will be difficult for the 14 to “beat” it and in the end there will be another “deterioration” in the camera.

⚪ Stayed the same ⚪

o Beautiful design (again a matter of taste, of course), but the glossy edges are still extreme fingerprint magnets, although they are now darker
o Very well made of quality (look and gap size), but very heavy compared to the competition and the materials make a very vulnerable impression, so that my mobile phone immediately ended up in a case with bulletproof glass (both from Spigen) - a shame because you don't see any of the beautiful design now
o Lightning to USB-C cable included and Still no USB-C on the device
o Display and color rendering very good again (no yellow tinge or the like)
o The bug that with a display brightness of ZERO, black pixels were displayed gray instead of black pixels is fortunately still fixed
o Still very good, if not the best, speakers (of this size) in terms of volume and quality!
o The 13 Pro Max had a very good battery life and the 14 Pro Max “can” keep up here too. Why can? Depending on the activated feature, such as the always-on display, the 14 Pro Max will then understandably last a bit shorter. But as always, you have to give the iPhone a few days until it “levels off.”

✔️ Positive and negative things about the camera ❌

+ In general, the camera has become a bit better again. Why something? Since it is already on a very high level anyway. Now, depending on the mode, with 48 MP instead of 12 MP. Do you notice them in everyday life? Not really!
+ The macro function has been improved a bit, BUT...
-... but it sometimes activates too early for my liking
+ Videos and photos in dark environments now look even better and...
+... Portrait mode has improved again in dark lighting conditions with the telephoto lens (3x and also 2x) (it was worse with the 13 than with the 12 and took blurred photos when shooting by hand)
-- What felt worse is the lens distortion. Faces distort much faster, especially when shooting at a “short” distance (2-3 m), i.e. when shooting in groups or people.

✔️ Positive and negative things about the display

+ Dynamic Island instead of the notch. I like the change and was one of the reasons for me to switch. What I like is that you can see many functions at a glance (such as timer, music, etc. pp.),...
-... however, it bothers a bit more in various apps, as it now sticks even further into the picture than the notch (but the advantage prevails for me)
+ even brighter than its predecessor, which makes it more pleasant to use in blazing sun
+ ProMotion: somehow looks even smoother or activates faster or smoother than the 13
+ always-on display, I really like it, but I deactivated it due to the battery life. I would still prefer a status LED (in various colors depending on the app)

* * * Conclusion * * *

Basically, not that much has happened with the 13 Pro Max, which is still the best iPhone for me! So is it worth upgrading? No, then I'd rather save the money and maybe wait for the 15th. The only features that stand out and could be useful in everyday life are the Dynamic Island and the always-on display. The camera does not take significantly better photos than its predecessor, so an upgrade here would be worthwhile. I even found the lens distortion to be much more extreme or negative than in the other two predecessors. You get the feeling that the camera system was designed more for landscape photography than for “normal” or “close” distances.

If the review was helpful, I would really appreciate a “useful” one. 👍
After much thought about which iPhone to get, I chose the iPhone 14 Pro Max and I'm very happy with it. The camera quality is fascinating!
What should you say? It's just an iPhone. I'm impressed with the battery life.
Shipping and delivery only with security code. I think it's good.
Good quality as usual.
Good quality and packing with my expectation.After a seven-month trip to the Android world, now an iPhone again. Due to the sharp rise in prices, I wanted to refuse to buy a new iPhone. Due to a relatively high drop in prices and a very good price here on Amazon, I have “struck” again. I can't even say exactly what I like better now, it was just “welcome home” after setting it up. The camera is great and on the level of various other high-end smartphones, the weight is already very high. The battery is awesome, I can get along with one charge 4x as long with the same usage behavior, I have no idea what I always do wrong with Android. Extremely smooth screen running in every situation. The unit rarely gets warm. For me, this is a really very successful iPhone generation.Excelente.Although its performance is sufficient for the moment, the fee charged is more. Apple may slow down the device with updates as part of planned obsolescence again after a time.I'm completely at peace, it's just a little heavy in the hand, could be a bit lighter. Otherwise great.Very expensive but simply awesome.Don't have an iPhone? Don't have an iPhone!
Fun by the side, the cell phone is perfect.
I switched from Android to the Apple universe again after a long time and I'm really satisfied. The only small drawback - how heavy can a cell phone be? Yes!I bought this case for my iPhone to completely protect it.
It is covered from all sides. The case is also slightly higher than the display itself (approx. 2-3 mm), which protects the smartphone from a frontal impact.
As a bonus for all Mag Safe lovers, this case has a corresponding magnet on the back. It is also handy for a magnetic cell phone holder:).

I thought at the beginning that it might look stupid since my iPhone is dark purple, but on the contrary that doesn't bother me at all.

In conclusion, it is really a great alternative to the original Apple phone case, which costs far twice as much. Price-performance ratio is therefore not to be criticized.

I highly recommend it!Just buy it if the item is offered at a low price, I did that and I didn't regret it! What a color! Still no USB-C, but so what! The performance, the feel when you have it in your hand, the razor-sharp display, the super-good speakers, the camera with its wide range of options - these are all attributes that also fit many other smartphones - but anyone who has landed on the 🍎 will appreciate the feeling of value and durability. Whether you retire the device in two years or in six years, it will work reliably for a long time with good treatment, and that was also the reason for my purchase decision. And since Apple only makes marginal changes to the hardware, only the software really has to play along, the update policy is exemplary anyway!So far so good. Love the sleek design, the camera, and the large screen! Oh! Can’t forget about the battery life and the quick charge. Only con is, it doesn’t come with a wall port. (Sold separately).The camera in particular is awesome!Price was super good for me. But while charging it becomes little hot. Rest is okay. fast delivery, good quality. Since my Android has slowly given up the ghost and yet I am somehow interested in iOS, I decided to buy an iPhone.

My hands are big and thick, so it was the 14 Pro Max - well... it's brutally expensive, but that's not how I hit 4 keys when writing messages -

The workmanship is terrific
- photos are very good!
-Display resolution and brightness are brilliant. The iPhone is great I am very satisfied. Very nice photos. It is just as easy to use as my predecessor.
As expected, everything was fine. Easy data transfer.I had Android for years and am now the happy owner of an iPhone 😀 as I like the big screens, I immediately got the iPhone 14 Pro Max with 128 GB in black. The camera is awesome, and very nice and high-quality cell phone. Thanks to the 1-day delivery from Amazon Prime, I had the iPhone the very next day. People buy you the cell phone:).Decision never regretted!I switched from my iPhone Xs to the 14 Pro Max and I'm absolutely thrilled. I use my smartphone for everything, almost as a computer replacement and I am delighted with the large and bright screen. Battery life is fantastic, for the first time a smartphone lasts the whole day. 20% discount also makes the product inexpensive, you get a great device that you can use as a work machine for everything.I purchased the iPhone 14 Pro Max from Amazon at a significantly lower price compared to the Apple website, which was a major plus. The delivery was prompt, arriving just two days after placing the order. I was pleased to find that this variant came with the SIM tray slot, which is a significant advantage for me. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase!Super fajny i ładny. Naturally, the iPhone 14 Pro Max, as with any product, has its well-known set of pros and cons. Among its notable strengths, the high-quality camera stands out for me, delivering exceptional results that align with the reputation Apple has built in this department. However, beyond the expected features, there's one specific aspect I'd like to emphasize: the choice of color. While personal preference plays a significant role in selecting a phone color, I would advise sticking with the original color options offered by Apple. I had experience with the purple color and unfortunately it scratched faster than the other colors.The phone was delivered quickly. In original packaging, everything is fine, no complaints.With 1450€ in the Apple Store, this device was €1200 on amazon. I received receipt for 1022€ with tax refund. The device is dual-line, one is physical SIM, the other is eSIM. Delivery was on time.Very good quality.okay. After using an iPhone 11 for a long time, I wanted to treat myself to the iPhone 14 Pro Max with a capacity of 256 GB, which I definitely don't regret. I won't go into all the technical details here, as they have already been described in detail by Apple and many other nice people who have commented on this.

It was a small adjustment to the biggest flagship, as it is already bigger than the normal iPhone model. I really like the Dynamic Island functionality, which I also find very practical. The OLED display is definitely more pleasant than the one on my previous iPhone 11. There has of course been a lot of change between the 11 and the current 14 model, which you definitely notice when using it.

Overall, the price of the iPhone 14 Pro Max isn't exactly cheap, but due to the fact that I've been using my smartphones for several years, the investment is quite okay for me.iPhone stop, high-quality workmanship, fast performance, there is nothing besseres.Bin absolutely enthusiastic about this iPhone, I switched from Android and I have not regretted it at all, quite the opposite. The smartphone is great. Shipping was quick!!Good. Delivery reached my hands very quickly and reliably. Since I reside in Turkey, I bought it when I went to Germany. With regard to tax refund and all my other questions amazon has been very helpful and supportive. Thank you @amazon. As described by the seller. I found the best deal on the amazon when compared to other websites. the iphone is preforming the pretty good.The new iPhone 14 Pro Max with a super camera. Take pictures and videos with sound quality and sharpness that is unparalleled and unlikely to find. Not even a 1 to 1 SLR camera. I can judge for myself.Delivery was almost fast. Everything is great.Everything is great, but it's great to go out 15 series:)))The Diplay is crisp and bright, the camera is amazing and the smartphone also has a great battery life. Not cheap fun, of course, but Samsung charges similar prices for the S23 Ultra. In return, the iPhone is provided with updates for much longer and the loss in value is not as high as with androids. Of course, it would be nice if you could customize your smartphone individually, such as adding your own ringtone instead of boring Apple ringtones or using File Explorer to move files onto the iPhone. Who knows, we might also experience miracles and Apple will unlock these functions.It's all ok.The iPhone 14 Pro Max continues Apple's tradition of outstanding quality. With 128 GB of storage space, it offers enough space for all my apps and media. The space black color gives the device an elegant and timeless aesthetic. I was skeptical about the notch at first, but it proved to be practical and doesn't interfere with everyday use. Overall, the iPhone 14 Pro Max is a solid, reliable device that meets the high standards I've come to expect from Apple.Fast delivery, recommended, always happy.Just a really cool cell phone. I'm surprised how good this cell phone is and then these perfect pictures are just awesome.The climb from Android to iOS was quite easy for me. Ok a few things take getting used to. Otherwise very happy with the iPhone. The battery lasts great. As things stand, I can only recommend it.The phone is nice but pretty big. Although it has a lot of features that will help you, it is uncomfortable to carry and keep in hand constantly. It is necessary not to ignore this when buying.

Shooting quality and functions as described.

It has a fairly high price in terms of price. The brand value is understandable, but the purchasing power of buyers should also be considered.What else can you say about that, is Apple quality. Very chic and very nice design. Great work Apple mega If you're out and about in the Apple universe, the 14 Pro Max is probably the ultimate at the moment. And it also works almost perfectly in every way. Nevertheless, prices are now at a level that probably only shareholders are happy about and which, in my opinion, are therefore unreasonably high compared to other premium smartphones from the Android universe (which also work very well).I've always had an iPhone and I'm more satisfied than ever. My iPhone is always heated. I am very satisfied. As an Apple freak, this purchase was a must. Super quality in workmanship and operation.Unfortunately, I slipped out of my hands right on the first day and already had two big scratches on the display. That was quick.I like the product colour and features and long battery duration.I switched from the S22 Ultra to the Iphone Max Pro. A really great phone. A few weeks ago, it was time for me. True to the motto: Courage for new things!
My old cell phone was slowly giving up its ghost and I was looking for something new.
I chose the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max.
My husband has been using iPhones for a long time, but so far I've only had Android phones.
As I said, I ordered the 14 Pro Max a few weeks ago and I have to tell you, I'm really impressed. Of course, the changeover took a bit of getting used to, but I got used to the system very quickly.
When the cell phone arrived, I was of course able to insert my old SIM card and get started right away.
I would like to share a very little bit of my life with you, which has to do directly with my cell phone.
In fact, I have an unusual hobby.
I've loved mountaineering ever since I was little and have expanded it more and more.
I now climb the highest feasible mountains on earth, often all alone.
From some peaks, I even jump down into the valley, of course with a special parachute.
My new iPhone from Apple is particularly suitable for this particular hobby. The camera is particularly important to me. The innovative 48 MP main camera with the quad pixel sensor not only takes great pictures, but also fantastic videos. Even when I climb the mountains, I take countless pictures and videos of the surrounding area.
The videos of me jumping off the mountains and freefalling are simply indescribable.
My old cameras often wobbled so much that the movies simply became very bad. However, the iPhone 14 Pro has a very high standard, which is also used by the film industry (4K HDR at 24 FPS). The action mode really ensures a smooth shot, which my friends love to watch.
Since I'm on the subject of the camera: the camera has four times higher resolution and what fascinates me in particular is that the camera simply takes super good pictures even in very little light.
Because it often happens that I find myself on some mountains even at night. Then of course I particularly like to take beautiful pictures at dusk.
Since I'm currently on the subject of spending the night on the mountain: When I'm lying in my igloo at night, I love to watch my videos or even downloaded videos.
The battery is simply unbeatable, as it can play back up to 29 hours of videos.
Of course, I always have a small power bank with me, but it's actually only for emergencies.
Speaking of emergencies, I was particularly impressed by the fact that the iPhone has several safety features that might save my life in an emergency.
Sometimes I don't have cell phone reception, which could cost me my life in an emergency, such as a fall or serious illness. The Apple iPhone 14 pro has a very special security feature. In an emergency, this safety feature passes on an SOS emergency call via satellite via text message, even without network reception.
I also find accident detection very useful. I work as an emergency counselor and know how quickly a serious car accident can happen and sometimes you no longer have the opportunity to call for help in the event of a serious accident. But the cell phone system recognizes a serious car accident and calls emergency services if you can't do it yourself anymore.
I told you that it is my first Apple iPhone and that I am sometimes a bit unsure of how to use it, especially when I can't ask my husband.
Fortunately, I have the Apple Care package for that.
With it, I have a great 24 hour support service.
A repair in case of accidental damage is also included in the package.
The advantage that it is also protected from dust and moisture is of course beneficial to me when hiking.
Because it is often very dusty on the mountains and sometimes the rain comes faster than I had hoped.
And I have to admit that a few years ago I only had the chance to land in a lake while jumping. My old cell phone broke down due to water damage back then.
But with the Apple iPhone, I have the chance that it will survive such an action, as it should survive well even at a depth of six meters for 30 minutes.
Another advantage of this mobile phone is that I can do many things at the same time and the mobile phone overlays several actions.
Since I am a very nature-loving person, I think it's super good that Apple makes the promise that they will develop all products CO2 neutral by 2030.
I also have a very good feeling about Apple when it comes to data protection, as they promise to handle my data sensitively.
I find the dimensions of 0.78*7.76*16.07 cm and the weight of 240 g very practical, because the large display allows me to do how many things I can do with a great mobile phone.
The large battery capacity also speaks in favour of the mobile phone.
I believe that I have one of the most technologically advanced cell phones, which takes really great pictures and videos and simply makes my life easier and above all more beautiful.
The only thing I find a shame is that a charger is no longer included in the package.
I know that from my other old man, of course.
That's why I ordered a USB-C power adapter right away, which allows me to charge my new mobile phone very quickly.

A friend tells me that she always has problems saving the data, as you can no longer use an SD card. She says she has to pay something for the cloud first before she can save the data.
But so far I still have a lot of the 256 GB storage space available.
But I'm sure they're also used up quickly, due to my many activities.

Great device, which I can only recommend.After using an iPhone 12 Pro Max from fall 2020, where the storage capacity is slowly running out of storage and I find the video improvements since the iPhone 13 Pro interesting, it is now time for a new iPhone.
The iPhone 14 Pro Max is once again manufactured to a very high quality and continues to have an excellent design since the iPhone 12, which is reminiscent of generations 4 to iPhone 5S.

The most important new features for me:
-Main camera significantly improved with up to 48 megapixels! However, in everyday life, only 12 megapixels and therefore hardly any difference in the size of the files. Good, because if you want to make full use of more pixels, you can switch to RAW (lots of editing potential, but huge files), but the quality of normal photos is simply improved. 
The focal length is now 24mm, i.e. slightly more wide angle (13 Pro: 26mm).
-Ultra wide-angle camera improved, should also be better for macro shots
-2x zoom back: As with the iPhone XS, you can now use 2x zoom optically again - an image section of the main camera instead of your own lens. Disadvantage: Probably lower quality in more difficult light than with 3x camera
Super Retina XDR display: The display is said to have improved even further. It seems extremely brilliant and sharp. In bright environments, it should even offer up to 2000 nits of brightness, meaning it should still be bright enough even in strong sunlight (up to twice as bright as previous iPhones). However, in a warm environment and simultaneous charging via power bank, etc., the display may dim and no longer offer full brightness, which I found problematic with the 12 Pro Max and has not yet been able to assess it with the 14 Pro Max.
-New processor or chip with probably a bit more performance, compared to the normal iPhone 14, which still comes with the processor from the previous year (only 1 more graphics core can be used in a normal iPhone 14, as with the 13 Pro).
-Always-On Display: As the name suggests, the display can stay on permanently and display energy-saving information at a low frame refresh rate. Can be very handy on a charging stand at a desk, for example... If you turn the iPhone around or put it in your pocket, the display should still switch off completely.
-Dynamic Island: Instead of the previous front camera and face recognition indentation at the top of the display, there is now a smaller, separate area that also integrates the display area all around to display information such as music playback, etc. A nice gimmick that is currently only reserved for the 14 Pro series.
-Cinema mode (for video recording) further improved and 4K

advantages compared to older devices (for anyone considering switching over):
-LiDAR scanner (since 12 Pro): future-proof -a big advantage for photography and filming in low light, improves the camera's auto-focus. In addition, there will probably be more and more AR applications, etc., which can make use of the new scanner.
-Ultra-wide-angle camera in addition compared to iPhone XS or older
-telephoto lens with 3x “zoom” compared to the iPhone 12 Pro (Max) (2.5x zoom) or only 2x “zoom” for iPhone XS or older
- photo quality in low light is significantly improved compared to older iPhones (generation XS and downwards) I find the difference gigantic, especially when shooting video at dusk... a lot improved since the iPhone 12.
-Sensor-stabilized camera in the 14 Pro Max — i.e. even better protection against shaking and advantages for video recordings. A big advantage over older generations before iPhone 12
action mode: A significant improvement for video recordings in motion, since iPhone 13 Pro (Max), can sometimes save a gimbal... but not at full resolution.
-Up to 1 TB capacity available since the iPhone 13 Pro (Max)
Apple ProRAW photo support (since iPhone 12 Pro). You can do more with the photos in post-processing (adjust colors, etc.), but a significantly larger memory size. Of course, it can be switched over
-ProRes and Dolby Vision HDR Video: Can be activated to record extremely high-quality, easy-to-edit videos, e.g. ideal for users who then want to edit in Final Cut Pro, etc... Of course, correspondingly high memory requirements. Available since iPhone 13 Pro or 12 Pro with Dolby Vision HDR.
-6 GB memory (RAM) - no progress compared to the predecessors since iPhone 12, but compared to older iPhones (before 12) or non-Pro models.
-long time updates: Compared to most Android devices, much longer support for new operating system versions with many new features and even security updates.
-iOS is constantly evolving and brings significant new features every year, even for old devices.
-Good water protection (after IP 68) - a significant improvement over previous iPhone 12
-5G support: Anyone who still uses iPhones before the 12th generation will also get an interesting improvement here
- battery life in Max makes a good impression on me. Quite a bit better than in the normal Pro version... so far I could hardly notice any differences compared to older Max models.
-MagSafe: magnetic system for connecting Qi chargers and other accessories to the back, installed since the iPhone 12. For 2 years, more and more useful MagSafe accessories have appeared, such as car holders, stands, wallets and much more...
-a slightly larger display than slightly older predecessor models (11 Pro Max, XS Max) - but also slightly larger housing

Disadvantages:
-Not yet the latest WLAN standard like 6E, still the same maximum Speed and the same standard as for years, therefore not as future-proof -
Unfortunately, ever new case sizes - old cases no longer fit... (MagSafe accessories such as wallets or stands are compatible with all iPhones over 12 though)
-No headphone jack, as has been the case since the iPhone 7. Cable headphones/headsets However, they can simply be plugged into a jack adapter via Lightning, or accessories can be connected directly with a Lightning plug (e.g. Apple EarPods).
-Face ID compared to devices with a home button: Sometimes unlocking with a fingerprint sensor would be more practical if the iPhone is lying flat on a table, for example. Apple has integrated this into the side button on the iPad Air. I would find it very desirable in addition to Face ID.
-No power supply/charger included since iPhone 12. For environmental reasons, the resulting smaller packaging is certainly an advantage. And many users already have enough chargers, but not everyone. But there are also many very cheap 18W or 20W USB-C power supplies that charge at least almost as fast as the original.
-iPhone prices in the EU have unfortunately risen significantly

Neutral:
-Hardly any improvement in the telephoto camera, still no more than 3x “zoom” or more telephoto focal length. In some cases, the competition offers significantly more... The quality is said to have improved only in low light, but presumably only via software.
-Lightning plug: I still think the Lightning connector on the iPhones is technically very good - the cables hold very well and the plug is pretty robust. Even multiple crashes on some iPhones directly onto the plug have not caused me any damage so far. USB C seems a bit more vulnerable to me and the connectors also need a little more space.
On the other hand, there are many more accessories for USB C, such as docks and adapters - unfortunately, the choice for Lightning is more limited. But I don't think that's so important on a smartphone, I find USB C more important with the iPad. Adapters to USB and SD card readers are also available for Lightning, among others.

Conclusion: In
my opinion, the iPhone 14 Pro Max is definitely the most technically advanced smartphone on the market right now. The Max version probably no longer has any technical advantages over the normal Pro, except for a larger battery in addition to the display.

In any case, I see the iPhone 14 Pro (Max) as an ideal choice for photographers and videographers. I find the video quality great and for many photo tasks it is completely sufficient if no smartphone can still replace full-frame DSLR/DSLM cameras.

For users of older models:
Anyone who still uses an iPhone 12 Pro (Max) will certainly appreciate significant camera advances; the difference from 13 Pro (Max) shouldn't be particularly great.
In my opinion, the speed of use has only improved slightly in recent years and even an 11 Pro or 12 Pro (Max) can keep up very well with most everyday tasks, I find even an XS Max fast enough - even for slightly more demanding users.Cons: First of all, this device has very bad ergonomics because it's just bit too heavy. I'm angry at myself I didn't predicted that before I ordered. I did check the device at local stores, and it felt just fine, but if I hold this heavy phone longer in my hands, it's just painful, and my pinky hurts - supporting this 240g device is not that easy. And if you add some case and screen protector then it's more than 240g.

2nd ergonomics issue is the dynamic island. So we have it, and above dynamic island there is ALWAYS some minimal space between top of the screen, and that space is NEVER used. To be honest I liked notch more, and the only reason for dynamic island are nice animations... but no real benefit apart from that. Yes, it's interactive, you can touch it, i will show you some of the information like incoming call etc, but it's not a killer feature. It's rather waste of energy for development.

Another issues is very painful migration if you switch from Android phone. Call history is not copied. Also, messages could be copied, but because of bug those copied messages are not indexed. It means that search functionality in messages app will not work with your old, migrated text messages. Fortunately there is some workaround, that you can force re-indexing of all messages, but this is something Apple should fix long time ago...

Speaking of Messages app. Both Messages and dialer look really dated and limited. Those are way less functional than stock OneUI apps. Also, level of UI refinement is not the same. It's bit surprising for me, because I heard many times that Apple products have perfect and well-though UI...

Pros: Screen is bright, sharp and has beautiful deep colors. Call quality is superb. Build quality is superb, that "premium feel" is there.I am absolutely amazed by the iPhone 14 Pro Max! This smartphone exceeded my expectations in many ways. The 48-megapixel main camera ensures breath-taking photos and videos that feature impressive levels of detail and color fidelity. Whether in daylight or in difficult lighting conditions, the camera always delivers first-class results.

The iPhone 14 Pro Max's battery is really impressive. I can easily get through the whole day without having to worry about an empty battery. Both when surfing the Internet, playing videos or using sophisticated apps, the battery lasts an astonishingly long time.

The iPhone 14 Pro Max's display is simply fantastic. The color reproduction is vivid and razor-sharp, and the size of the screen allows me to immerse myself in my content. Regardless of whether I'm watching movies, playing games or looking at photos, the display is convincing across the board.

The design of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is simply elegant. The smooth glass back and high-quality metal frame give the device an aesthetic touch. The smartphone is comfortable to hold and feels robust. The workmanship is first-class and gives a feeling of longevity.

The performance of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is simply outstanding. Thanks to the powerful processor and optimized software, everything runs smoothly and quickly. Whether it's multitasking, opening demanding apps, or running graphic-intensive games, the iPhone 14 Pro Max does it all with ease.

Overall, I am completely impressed by this smartphone. The iPhone 14 Pro Max offers an impressive camera, an outstanding battery, a great display, a classy appearance and high-quality workmanship. It is definitely worth the price and meets all my expectations for a top-end smartphone. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a premium phone. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is undoubtedly a masterpiece of modern technology. The design is breathtaking - the premium materials and sleek finish make it a real gem.
The camera quality is exceptional. The clarity and color reproduction are really impressive, and thanks to the Pro camera settings, it's easier than ever to create professional-looking photos and videos.
As far as performance is concerned, the iPhone 14 Pro Max is outstanding. The speed and responsiveness are unbeatable, and the battery life is remarkably long, which means you can be productive all day without having to worry about charging.
The user experience, which has been improved by the new iOS, is as smooth and intuitive as ever. It also offers a wide range of apps and services that make life easier.
The iPhone 14 Pro Max is undoubtedly the best iPhone Apple has brought to market so far. It's an expensive device, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny. This iPhone sets the standard for future smartphones. I would highly recommend it.The Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is Apple's latest flagship smartphone and offers a wide range of features that make it one of the best smartphones on the market. With 256 GB of internal storage, this device has more than enough space for all your photos, videos, and apps.

The iPhone 14 Pro Max features a 6.7-inch Super Retina XDR display that offers an incredible 2778 x 1284 pixel resolution. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures a smooth and responsive experience when scrolling or gaming.

The iPhone 14 Pro Max features a triple camera with 12-megapixel wide-angle, ultra-wide-angle and telephoto lens, which offers impressive image quality and a wide range of features, including night vision mode, deep fusion and Smart HDR 4.0.

This device also has improved battery life, providing up to 28 hours of talk time and 95 hours of music playback. It also supports 5G networks, Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 and is equipped with the latest A16 Bionic chip, which ensures fast and responsive work.

In summary, the Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max is an impressive smartphone that offers a wide range of features. With a large internal memory, an impressive display, a powerful camera and improved battery life, this device is a great choice for anyone looking for a powerful smartphone.Man, oh man, what a good quality. My expectations were even exceeded. Everything fits and is right all around. Had a Huawei before, which also means a certain period of changeover. The photo performance of the Huawei was also very good, the iPhone comes with it. Above all, the iPhone helps me make calls, as conversations are now transferred from the iPhone to the hearing aids via Bluetooth in excellent voice quality. Well, the price is also huge, of course, but so far I haven't regretted the purchase and there is also a lot of performance behind it. Anyone who can do it financially should buy it.I have treated myself to the new iPhone 14 Pro Max and am 🤩 - once Apple, always Apple ‼️ I managed
the registration/process all by myself - actually a tech nerd - including bank apps etc...No need to talk about Apple products in general, but the 14 Pro max I purchased compared to the 13 Pro Max I had is scratching easily after couple of days of use... While the 13th coating is resisting in the same conditions with 2 years of use and no single scratch... It looks like that instead of upgrading their product finishing, Apple goes backwards in this aspect.'m referring here to my iPhone 13 Pro Max review (https://www.amazon.de/gp/customer-reviews/RJSH8YJZQ0YPD) or a comparison to the predecessor in general.

Something has happened “in theory” to the predecessor, but do you notice anything about it in everyday life!? I was very satisfied with my 13 Pro Max, so it will be difficult for the 14 to “beat” it and in the end there will be another “deterioration” in the camera.

⚪ Stayed the same ⚪

o Beautiful design (again a matter of taste, of course), but the glossy edges are still extreme fingerprint magnets, although they are now darker
o Very well made of quality (look and gap size), but very heavy compared to the competition and the materials make a very vulnerable impression, so that my mobile phone immediately ended up in a case with bulletproof glass (both from Spigen) - a shame because you don't see any of the beautiful design now
o Lightning to USB-C cable included and Still no USB-C on the device
o Display and color rendering very good again (no yellow tinge or the like)
o The bug that with a display brightness of ZERO, black pixels were displayed gray instead of black pixels is fortunately still fixed
o Still very good, if not the best, speakers (of this size) in terms of volume and quality!
o The 13 Pro Max had a very good battery life and the 14 Pro Max “can” keep up here too. Why can? Depending on the activated feature, such as the always-on display, the 14 Pro Max will then understandably last a bit shorter. But as always, you have to give the iPhone a few days until it “levels off.”

✔️ Positive and negative things about the camera ❌

+ In general, the camera has become a bit better again. Why something? Since it is already on a very high level anyway. Now, depending on the mode, with 48 MP instead of 12 MP. Do you notice them in everyday life? Not really!
+ The macro function has been improved a bit, BUT...
-... but it sometimes activates too early for my liking
+ Videos and photos in dark environments now look even better and...
+... Portrait mode has improved again in dark lighting conditions with the telephoto lens (3x and also 2x) (it was worse with the 13 than with the 12 and took blurred photos when shooting by hand)
-- What felt worse is the lens distortion. Faces distort much faster, especially when shooting at a “short” distance (2-3 m), i.e. when shooting in groups or people.

✔️ Positive and negative things about the display

+ Dynamic Island instead of the notch. I like the change and was one of the reasons for me to switch. What I like is that you can see many functions at a glance (such as timer, music, etc. pp.),...
-... however, it bothers a bit more in various apps, as it now sticks even further into the picture than the notch (but the advantage prevails for me)
+ even brighter than its predecessor, which makes it more pleasant to use in blazing sun
+ ProMotion: somehow looks even smoother or activates faster or smoother than the 13
+ always-on display, I really like it, but I deactivated it due to the battery life. I would still prefer a status LED (in various colors depending on the app)

* * * Conclusion * * *

Basically, not that much has happened with the 13 Pro Max, which is still the best iPhone for me! So is it worth upgrading? No, then I'd rather save the money and maybe wait for the 15th. The only features that stand out and could be useful in everyday life are the Dynamic Island and the always-on display. The camera does not take significantly better photos than its predecessor, so an upgrade here would be worthwhile. I even found the lens distortion to be much more extreme or negative than in the other two predecessors. You get the feeling that the camera system was designed more for landscape photography than for “normal” or “close” distances.

If the review was helpful, I would really appreciate a “useful” one. After much thought about which iPhone to get, I chose the iPhone 14 Pro Max and I'm very happy with it. The camera quality is fascinating!What should you say? It's just an iPhone. I'm impressed with the battery life.Shipping and delivery only with security code. I think it's good.Good quality as usual. Good quality and packing with my expectation.After a seven-month trip to the Android world, now an iPhone again. Due to the sharp rise in prices, I wanted to refuse to buy a new iPhone. Due to a relatively high drop in prices and a very good price here on Amazon, I have “struck” again. I can't even say exactly what I like better now, it was just “welcome home” after setting it up. The camera is great and on the level of various other high-end smartphones, the weight is already very high. The battery is awesome, I can get along with one charge 4x as long with the same usage behavior, I have no idea what I always do wrong with Android. Extremely smooth screen running in every situation. The unit rarely gets warm. For me, this is a really very successful iPhone generation.Although its performance is sufficient for the moment, the fee charged is more. Apple may slow down the device with updates as part of planned obsolescence again after a time.I'm completely at peace, it's just a little heavy in the hand, could be a bit lighter. Otherwise great.Very expensive but simply awesome.Don't have an iPhone? Don't have an iPhone!
Fun by the side, the cell phone is perfect.
I switched from Android to the Apple universe again after a long time and I'm really satisfied. The only small drawback - how heavy can a cell phone be? Yes!I bought this case for my iPhone to completely protect it.
It is covered from all sides. The case is also slightly higher than the display itself (approx. 2-3 mm), which protects the smartphone from a frontal impact.
As a bonus for all Mag Safe lovers, this case has a corresponding magnet on the back. It is also handy for a magnetic cell phone holder:).

I thought at the beginning that it might look stupid since my iPhone is dark purple, but on the contrary that doesn't bother me at all.

In conclusion, it is really a great alternative to the original Apple phone case, which costs far twice as much. Price-performance ratio is therefore not to be criticized.

I highly recommend it!Just buy it if the item is offered at a low price, I did that and I didn't regret it! What a color! Still no USB-C, but so what! The performance, the feel when you have it in your hand, the razor-sharp display, the super-good speakers, the camera with its wide range of options - these are all attributes that also fit many other smartphones - but anyone who has landed on the 🍎 will appreciate the feeling of value and durability. Whether you retire the device in two years or in six years, it will work reliably for a long time with good treatment, and that was also the reason for my purchase decision. And since Apple only makes marginal changes to the hardware, only the software really has to play along, the update policy is exemplary anyway!So far so good. Love the sleek design, the camera, and the large screen! Oh! Can’t forget about the battery life and the quick charge. Only con is, it doesn’t come with a wall port. (Sold separately)The camera in particular is awesome!Is simply a super smartphone Price was super good for me. But while charging it becomes little hot. Rest is okay fast delivery, good quality. Since my Android has slowly given up the ghost and yet I am somehow interested in iOS, I decided to buy an iPhone.

My hands are big and thick, so it was the 14 Pro Max - well... it's brutally expensive, but that's not how I hit 4 keys when writing messages -

The workmanship is terrific
- photos are very good!
-Display resolution and brightness are brilliant.The iPhone is great I am very satisfied. Very nice photos. It is just as easy to use as my predecessor.As expected, everything was fine. Easy data transfer.I had Android for years and am now the happy owner of an iPhone 😀 as I like the big screens, I immediately got the iPhone 14 Pro Max with 128 GB in black. The camera is awesome, and very nice and high-quality cell phone. Thanks to the 1-day delivery from Amazon Prime, I had the iPhone the very next day. People buy you the cell phone. Decision never regretted!I switched from my iPhone Xs to the 14 Pro Max and I'm absolutely thrilled. I use my smartphone for everything, almost as a computer replacement and I am delighted with the large and bright screen. Battery life is fantastic, for the first time a smartphone lasts the whole day. 20% discount also makes the product inexpensive, you get a great device that you can use as a work machine for everything.I purchased the iPhone 14 Pro Max from Amazon at a significantly lower price compared to the Apple website, which was a major plus. The delivery was prompt, arriving just two days after placing the order. I was pleased to find that this variant came with the SIM tray slot, which is a significant advantage for me. Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase! Naturally, the iPhone 14 Pro Max, as with any product, has its well-known set of pros and cons. Among its notable strengths, the high-quality camera stands out for me, delivering exceptional results that align with the reputation Apple has built in this department. However, beyond the expected features, there's one specific aspect I'd like to emphasize: the choice of color. While personal preference plays a significant role in selecting a phone color, I would advise sticking with the original color options offered by Apple. I had experience with the purple color and unfortunately it scratched faster than the other colors.The phone was delivered quickly. In original packaging, everything is fine, no complaints.With 1450€ in the Apple Store, this device was €1200 on amazon. I received receipt for 1022€ with tax refund. The device is dual-line, one is physical SIM, the other is eSIM. Delivery was on time.Very good quality. okay. After using an iPhone 11 for a long time, I wanted to treat myself to the iPhone 14 Pro Max with a capacity of 256 GB, which I definitely don't regret. I won't go into all the technical details here, as they have already been described in detail by Apple and many other nice people who have commented on this.

It was a small adjustment to the biggest flagship, as it is already bigger than the normal iPhone model. I really like the Dynamic Island functionality, which I also find very practical. The OLED display is definitely more pleasant than the one on my previous iPhone 11. There has of course been a lot of change between the 11 and the current 14 model, which you definitely notice when using it.

Overall, the price of the iPhone 14 Pro Max isn't exactly cheap, but due to the fact that I've been using my smartphones for several years, the investment is quite okay for me.iPhone stop, high-quality workmanship, fast performance, there is nothing besseres.Bin absolutely enthusiastic about this iPhone, I switched from Android and I have not regretted it at all, quite the opposite The smartphone is great. Shipping was quick!!Good Delivery reached my hands very quickly and reliably. Since I reside in Turkey, I bought it when I went to Germany. With regard to tax refund and all my other questions amazon has been very helpful and supportive. Thank you @amazon As described by the seller I found the best deal on the amazon when compared to other websites. the iphone is preforming the pretty good.The new iPhone 14 Pro Max with a super camera. Take pictures and videos with sound quality and sharpness that is unparalleled and unlikely to find. Not even a 1 to 1 SLR camera. I can judge for myself.Delivery was almost fast. Everything is great.The Diplay is crisp and bright, the camera is amazing and the smartphone also has a great battery life. Not cheap fun, of course, but Samsung charges similar prices for the S23 Ultra. In return, the iPhone is provided with updates for much longer and the loss in value is not as high as with androids. Of course, it would be nice if you could customize your smartphone individually, such as adding your own ringtone instead of boring Apple ringtones or using File Explorer to move files onto the iPhone. Who knows, we might also experience miracles and Apple will unlock these functions.The iPhone 14 Pro Max continues Apple's tradition of outstanding quality. With 128 GB of storage space, it offers enough space for all my apps and media. The space black color gives the device an elegant and timeless aesthetic. I was skeptical about the notch at first, but it proved to be practical and doesn't interfere with everyday use. Overall, the iPhone 14 Pro Max is a solid, reliable device that meets the high standards I've come to expect from Apple.Fast delivery, recommended, always happy.Just a really cool cell phone. I'm surprised how good this cell phone is and then these perfect pictures are just awesome.The climb from Android to iOS was quite easy for me. Ok a few things take getting used to. Otherwise very happy with the iPhone. The battery lasts great. As things stand, I can only recommend it.The phone is nice but pretty big. Although it has a lot of features that will help you, it is uncomfortable to carry and keep in hand constantly. It is necessary not to ignore this when buying.

Shooting quality and functions as described.

It has a fairly high price in terms of price. The brand value is understandable, but the purchasing power of buyers should also be considered.What else can you say about that, is Apple quality. Very chic and very nice design. Great work Apple.If you're out and about in the Apple universe, the 14 Pro Max is probably the ultimate at the moment. And it also works almost perfectly in every way. Nevertheless, prices are now at a level that probably only shareholders are happy about and which, in my opinion, are therefore unreasonably high compared to other premium smartphones from the Android universe (which also work very well).I've always had an iPhone and I'm more satisfied than ever. My iPhone is always heated.I am very satisfied. As an Apple freak, this purchase was a must. Super quality in workmanship and operation.Unfortunately, I slipped out of my hands right on the first day and already had two big scratches on the display. That was quick.I like the product colour and features and long battery duration.I switched from the S22 Ultra to the Iphone Max Pro. A really great phone. Nice color, good quality. Completely satisfied and the usual Apple quality - fast and flawless shipment
I bought the iPhone 14 Pro Max in gold with 128GB storage and am really impressed by this device. First of all, I purchased this unit via Amazon Warehouse — nothing wrong with it.

About the iPhone itself: First of all, the design is breathtaking. The gold is really nice and gives the phone a luxurious look. The size of the phone is perfect and the curved edge of the display is a nice detail. The workmanship of the phone is also very high-quality and it feels very solid and sturdy.

But what really sets the iPhone 14 Pro Max apart is the technology that goes into it. The processor is incredibly fast and the performance is remarkable. The display is absolutely fantastic and offers incredible resolution and color reproduction. I've never seen such an impressive display on a phone.

The camera is also amazing. The photos are razor-sharp and the colors are vivid and powerful. The low light function is impressive and I can now take beautiful photos even in low light conditions. I'm also really impressed with the video feature and the ability to record in 4K. The 128GB storage space is sufficient for my needs.

Overall, I am very satisfied with the iPhone 14 Pro Max in gold with 128GB storage. The design is beautiful, the technology is impressive, and the performance is excellent. If you're looking for a new high-priced smartphone, then I can highly recommend the iPhone 14 Pro Max.There is actually nothing to complain about, the iPhone is and remains a great cell phone, it's a bit heavy but you accept that...well, obviously picture quality is crazy
audio is out of this world
amazing mobile that even though it hurts paying so much for a mobile
its WORTH IT. Gut. Okay I'm so happy with the iPhone. I can only recommend. I am very happy with it it is great cell phone
thanks Amazon. Thank you very well. A must for iPhone fans, I love it!I bought the 14Pro Max and I have to say great device. Hassle-free product and delivery thanks.SUPERRR!! , THANKS!!What can I say, anyone who knows and loves Apple products is simply satisfied.
If everything was great, I would order it from Amazon again.A lot thanks to the authorities in my hand that the phone reached immaculate without any problems. There is currently no better smartphone from Apple, there is no need to write more, everything else is well known.
The battery lasts four days, no other smartphone can do that quickly!
It’s Apple so else do you want to say.I am very satisfied after switching from 11pro max. to 14 pro max. Delivery quickly and arrived well packaged.Unfortunately, the package had a small hole ripped open at the reception, but that was only on the outside!!
The iPhone has been
set up by me in the meantime. I had already bought the same smartphone in December, so I know it!
The camera is awesome, the battery also lasts longer than my old iPhone 12 Pro Max. Apple is just Apple! Unfortunately much too
expensive. Ideal for Apple! I love the feel.
expensive,!Pre-ordered for the release, arrived shortly after the release and what can you say, a significant upgrade from the Samsung S22 Ultra. Three quarters of a year later, I'm still very satisfied, use it privately and professionally, the battery life is simply great. I can only recommend to everyone not to put the part in any cheap plastic or rubber cases and ruin the fabulous feel, but to complete Apple Care+ instead.Since the iPhone 5, I've gone through almost all upgrades. And yes: the iPhone 14 Pro Max is simply good. Intuitive, secure software and long updates. I think it'll be 6 - 7 years. The camera is simply great and if there is also an Apple Watch, an iPad and Mac Book or iMac in the house/office, there is no way around the iPhone.Although this device is only a minimal, solid upgrade to its predecessor.

The display is crisp and smooth as butter thanks to a 120 Hz refresh rate. The sound is great and there are no complaints even when it comes to 4G/5G reception and telephony.

The Dynamic Island is a nice gimmick and will hopefully be used even more than before.

It is not possible to upgrade the storage system, so you should consider what you need or will need in the future before buying.
With 1 TB, however, you are always well served, as 4K videos and RAW photo files take up a lot of space.

The ultrawide sensor is still not equipped with optical image stabilization... that's not good, but tolerable. The difference between the camera and the 13 Pro Max is barely there. But anyone who comes from a 12 or older will notice the upgrade.

There is still only 6GB RAM. 8GB would be overdue here.

However, the new black color is very appealing and goes with every case without exception.

Here too, a clear purchase recommendation for people with the necessary small change ;-) Amazon must

also be mentioned in praise, because I first ordered the device from Apple myself. After weeks of waiting, it turned out on the day it was to be delivered and the days after that that, that a UPS employee was probably more interested in the device and simply kept it, even though I paid for it... which resulted in weeks of back and forth. BUT everything went smoothly and uncomplicated on Amazon. Here, the device was delivered very quickly and satisfactorily! Thank you once again that everything is going great here!!!!I actually come from the Android universe, but was now able to purchase this mobile phone through my company.
It reacts fantastically, everything feels smoother on this device. You have to get used to it, but that was obvious from the start.

What I don't like is that you get a lot of Apple apps to try out for months at the beginning. However, I often forget to cancel subscriptions in good time and therefore often have to pay again. So I take out subscriptions and cancel them immediately, and then I can just use the period without paying again afterwards.

Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple TV, etc. cancel the service immediately during the test phase, so I completed all subscriptions and canceled them again immediately. Which has now removed every service for me. Schade. I've switched from Android to iOS and I simply have to say that the iPhone 14 Pro Max is the most powerful smartphone on the market. The UI, the smooth transition from app to home screen and vice versa. Plus the privacy that is given to Apple users and the associated Safari, which doesn't allow the sites not to track me and I can see who's tried to create a profile of me. Plus the unique Air Pods Pro (2nd generation), which in my opinion are number 1 headphones in terms of noise cancellation, bass, sound. Seriously, how crazy must it be that when you put on your headphones alone without listening to music, the noise suppression is so intense that something loud in front of you sounds incredibly quiet. Very admirable on the one hand, but on the other hand, you are almost completely cut off from noises, as you often have to pay attention to your surroundings. Still, I give an 11/10 for the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the headphones with a kiss hand. Apple, you've produced something very cool!Fast shipping everyting is korekt. One of the best thing and they delivered with with intensively care and security. Super After I replaced my old iPhone with a new one, I also ordered this one for my wife. Happy wife, happy life. She is delighted. She'd rather have this Max version, it would be too big for my shirt pocket, but my mistress thinks it's perfect that way.I like the size, it fits perfectly in a hand. So, the design is really niceI think it's not necessary to rate the iPhone here - everyone knows how the product is and what it can do.

The process with the delivery, the code that Amazon wanted and everything around it was very secure and went smoothly. It is definitely recommended to order such devices via Amazon, as no one delivers faster and offers them cheaper.. However, I am not fully satisfied with the camera quality, it has only 3x digital zoom, after switching from Samsung Galaxy I noticed that this iPhone is worse at taking macro photos, so if it's something important to you, it's better to consider then pro or pro max versions. So, I was skeptical at first about the selfie quality, but after a few months, I think it's okay, it just doesn't apply the automatic smooth skin effect as Samsung does. Other than that, I don't see any issues with it and I find this phone really nice, easy to use, and stable (I accidentally dropped it a few times from the bed height and it's all right).I am very satisfied with the delivery of the iPhone. I'm also very happy with the iPhone14.
Amazon is a reliable supplier. Price unbeatable!!There is probably nothing more to add to the well-known quality of the iPhones.
I've been moving around this world and safely comfortably for years...The iPhone 14 is a nice great smartphone. The handling and usability are very easy. In contrast to Android, the iPhone offers much better usability and, above all, better IT security. I use it purely digitally for all office tasks, from printing to writing and signing documents. Unfortunately I received a faulty iPhone, I will now return it. This can certainly happen with a mass-produced product. Still, the product is great! I will definitely only use one iPhone for the rest of my life. The photo function surprises me, because the photos are almost as good as with a professional camera.he girlfriend is now completely satisfied.As always, a great cell phone.

It's an iPhone, what else can you say??The switch from 7 to 14 isn't quite successful yet, but I admire the transfer from one device to the other. It couldn't be easier. Great.Anyone who knows Apple can't go wrong here. Great phone. Huge upgrade for me. Great seller. Fast delivery. Thank you./ What should you capitalize there?
iPhone 14 128GB originally packaged and sealed, model for the German market (CE), very good price and delivery took less than 12 hours... Respect 👍🏼 A clear recommendation from
me and 5 stars plus ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️+++Don't use it yourself - the user hasn't reported any problems so far and is completely satisfied. Apple has once again brought a very good product onto the market.The iPhone 6s needed a replacement because I wanted to participate in general technical progress. Therefore now iPhone 14. I would certainly have been just as satisfied with a Galaxy from Samsung in the same performance class. However, I didn't want to change the system.Siri now goes “mmmhhh” and looks even more human! :-)
It will take weeks and months until all the innovations can be discovered and used. We have been an Apple-loving family for years and are always enthusiastic about the technology and, above all, the feel!Display reaction, always 👍. For me I think it doesn't get any better than this; cheaper would be desirable 🫣. And I think you're forced to buy a new one because you don't get any more updates 🤢
TOP, I have nothing negative to say. Anyone interested in a current iPhone can access it without hesitation. As usual, excellent workmanship and top performance are the strongest points. The OS is easy to use and very simple.

The only drawback, like the years before: the price Ordering and delivery went very well and quickly, I'm satisfied.I really like the color but I would rather go for 14 per. The product/brand speaks for itself!I have had Apple devices for a long time and am very satisfied with them. he iPhone is great. Battery lasts two days. Transferring from the old iPhone went smoothly. Handling is super easy and conclusive.

But the delivery: I live in a really large residential complex on the 2nd floor (about 50 parties including a physio practice - so a lot of people on the move every day) and I have my iPhone, which fortunately is not marked as such, in the evening after work Elevator encountered on the ground floor! Lucky you!It's all ok. Thank you very much.I've always been an iPhone fan. The delivery from Amazon was great. What can I say, it’s an Iphone. I have always used the Pro versions of the iPhone and no longer see the need to spend significantly more than €1000 on a smartphone.

So this time I decided to use a “normal” iPhone. I have to say that my expectations were much lower and the big disappointment I expected (since it's no longer a Pro) didn't happen at all.

Battery life, display, camera, performance are all very TOP and I don't miss anything. I don't necessarily need the third camera lens that you only use once or twice a year. I am not a professional photographer and the current camera lenses are more than enough for everyday life such as family photos.

I will always use this version in the future!It's simply amazing what Apple can do. 🤩
In my opinion it's worth the money!You pay for the name The best smartphone I've had so far
A great cell phone. After my iPhone
Actually, the differences and innovations in the 14 are so small that it's hardly worth buying.
I recommend everyone to research and compare this based on their needs because it's really only marginal.
Since the price of the iPhone 14 then fell, I decided to go with it anyway, I think I would have been happy with the 13 too.
I hope that the device will serve for a few years now.Fast delivery, great service. Sorry i can not write about iPhone it’s really always the best.After having Huawei for years and inevitably having to switch to Samsung / Android, I was not at all satisfied. That's why I just got this iPhone and I have to say it's absolutely great. The cell phone, operating system and everyday handling are world class. Conclusion: Clear recommendation and never again the illness of Android!Works great, like everything from Apple - which we have been able to test so far ;)But too expensive..I got the new iPhone 14 and am really excited about it! I previously had the iPhone 10 and have to say that the upgrade is really worth it.

The design of the iPhone 14 is truly stunning and it also feels great in the hand. The display is really impressive with vibrant colors and a super sharp resolution.

What really impresses is the speed. Thanks to the A16 Bionic chip, the iPhone 14 feels incredibly fast and operation is very smooth. The camera has also received a real upgrade compared to the iPhone 10 - the images are razor-sharp and still rich in detail even in poor lighting conditions.

I also find the longer battery life of the iPhone 14 particularly positive. I can easily work with it all day without the battery running out.

All in all, I am really very happy with the iPhone 14 and can recommend it to anyone who is looking for a new smartphone. The improvements over the iPhone 10 are definitely noticeable and it's just a pleasure to work with this device.What should I capitalize? Everything went to my complete satisfaction. The gift was well received. :-)Great for Apple fans - nice part - fast delivery!Very good. the phone is great, it's my own fault that I didn't see that it was used...The cell phone is really great. The battery lasts a long time and the photos are really great. Super product. After years back to Apple and hit the mark with the 14. Everything just fits together. The camera performance in particular is impressive, although I have no comparison with the Pro, I can only give it my full recommendation for those who are still considering it and are undecided.So I had Android cell phones for a long time and thought okay. Now I bought the iPhone 14 and I have to say I'm so happy with it after just one day. On the one hand, the apps via IOS in the Apple Store are much better programmed and also have more extensive content and operation and options, on the other hand, the settings such as "GPS only when using the app" actually work and not like on Android. where I always had to turn off the GPS manually afterwards. The menu navigation and the setting options are much clearer and better designed. Which is of course great, but with Apple, for many apps, such as Instagram, I can only choose to a limited extent whether the app can send me advertising or not. This wasn't possible on Android. I haven't really tried out the camera yet, but it also has much better features than Android. If I compare it like that, all in all the Apple is a luxurious sedan and Android is a small car. As an addition, I would add that the iPhone fully synchronizes with my MacBook Pro and iPad and I have everything on hand for photos, emails and appointment management. In addition, I'm still with Apple in the cloud, which you can book using your Apple ID - pretty cheaply in my opinion. I will never buy another system again.

Fast delivery!!!Great quality, great device takes great pictures and is very fast. Quick delivery. Great quality. So far the iPhone has brought nothing but joy. Thanks Once you're in the Apple ecosystem, you don't want to leave!
We have all Apple devices in the household but the 13 mini surprised us.
In terms of performance, no compromises compared to the normal iPhone 13, but a wonderfully slim form factor.Good quality. The iPhone 14 is very good.As usual, the iPhone was delivered very quickly.
It has a long battery life and looks elegant.I'm coming from an iPhone 11 and I'm very satisfied.
The battery performance and the camera are impressive.You don't need to write anything about the iPhone. The devices are simply great.

The delivery from Amazon was quick and also secure with the pin code received by email.

The price was unbeatable.The iPhone 14 is fast and reliable.
2 SIM cards in use, one in “Nano” format and one E-SIM.
Activating the E-SIM is quick and easy on the phone - it takes the longest time for the provider to provide the E-SIM. Here at a “Vodafon reseller” everything was done in about 30 minutes.
LTE reception is very good, as is 5G, at least in Berlin Mitte.
WiFi support on the iPhone is very good, as it has been since the beginning of Apple phones.
The display is large and sharp, easy on the eyes and has a very large color space, which is particularly helpful for videos and photos. Camera really great, little noise, sound in videos is usually very well controlled.
Battery runtimes good to very good depending on usage, usually around 30 hours until things get tighter.
Can only recommend the phone.Gladly again iPhone - you can't go wrong!Switching from Android to Apple was difficult for me at first. Now I don't want to be without the iPhone anymore. In particular, the connectivity within the Apple world is outstanding. Even the “small” iPhone works smoothly and great. Didn't think I'd say that. The disadvantage is and remains the high price.Like all iPhones, great.Very good product again and again. Top. I can't quite understand the criticism that so little has changed compared to the predecessor. I don't buy a new car when it's due for a facelift, but instead wait for the direct successor. The iPhone 14 is a facelift from the 12 and 13, which you can tell directly from its appearance. I jumped from the 11 to the 14 and am already noticing clear differences.

+ great workmanship
+ elegant design without noticeable edges or gaps
+ display is very well made and bright
+ the iOS. The heart, as always, is THE reason to buy an iPhone. In addition to various Apple devices, I have used pretty much all operating systems and manufacturers from the last few years. That's why I don't want to start a fundamental discussion. For me, Apple's system is the tip of the spear. If you now use several devices from the Apple universe, the whole thing increases even more and you have a biotope that couldn't be more ingenious.
+ Camera and the new video functions are very good. Anyone who criticizes that Apple doesn't have 60 or 120MP should be told: Take a look at the pictures in comparison. More pixels does not mean better! But you have to score points with something, if it's not the operating system
+ the transfer of data from the old phone to the new device. As always, simple, quick and brilliantly simple

- Preis. Very good, value for money on Amazon too. Very nice apple products to shop from amazon. Everything with iphone 14 is good. Nice packaging.What is there to say about an iPhone? As always, almost everything is perfect, and the rest is close. As always, the price is also a stumbling block, especially (also as always) the hefty surcharge for more storage space.Eh, great and the installment payment without interest for 12 months makes it affordable.Class. ve never used an iPhone but one thing is certain for me: never buy Android again!

+Battery - incredibly strong (lasted 2 days)
+Speed
​​+Processing
+Easier to use - I would never have thought
+Cameras
+Security

- You can't send music via WhatsApp. You have to buy Apple Music to do this, aren't you serious!?
For 1000 euros that's really a disgrace. The point goes to Samsung this time. Great cell phone, great photos and the battery can easily last you two days. Delivery was slightly delayed, but that's okay. Packaging and device in perfect condition, I am very satisfied.Anyone who has an Apple device knows what they have. Normal brug. Transporting data from the new to the old iPhone is extremely easy using Bluetooth. The data is transferred 1 to 1. Thanks to facial recognition, you can connect to your cell phone very quickly. The iPhone 14 is extremely light and easy to handle.It's only enough for 3 stars because I still find it too expensive at 128 GB. The phone works great and the camera is great.I switched from an iPhone X to the new iPhone 14 model in purple. The phone is very good as expected. It's absolutely intuitive to use, looks good, the battery lasts a long time and can be charged quickly.I previously had the iPhone XR and now the iPhone 14 top device.Its camera has an advanced focusing function compared to the iPhone 13.
The battery lasts about 1 day (I use the phone frequently).
Classic iPhone design, ergonomic and easy to use.
I also want a charging adapter to come out of the box, only the cable comes out.

In general I give 4 stars as a phone considering its price.camera for iPhone 14 isn't high quality. Apple iPhone and I'm surprised at how easy and easy it is, the technology is one+ and very interesting to work with!I deliberately leave out how great (from Apple fans' point of view) or how bad an iPhone is (from Android fans' point of view) and try to limit my review to the facts and real innovations of the iPhone 14 Pro.

Right at the beginning, an important note for people who want to film professionally in ProRes 4K with the iPhone 14 Pro:

► ⚠️ ProRes 4K requires at least 256 GB variant ⚠️

The iPhone 13 Pro and the iPhone 13 Pro Max can already record videos in the advanced ProRes Record format. However, for the highest resolution in 4K, a model with at least 256 GB of memory or more is required. This will not change this year either, so the same restrictions still apply.
“iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max support ProRes video recording in the camera app at 1080p 30 fps with the 128 GB storage option and up to 4K 30 fps with the 256 GB, 512 GB and 1 TB storage options.” So if you need ProRes. 4K must necessarily use 256 GB or more.

► ⭐️ Dynamic Island: the real reason to buy? ✨

Smartphone manufacturers have been using so-called punchhole displays for years. Now Apple is also installing one in its new iPhone 14 Pro. And shows the industry once again how to make features more attractive.
The Dynamic Island was actually the reason for me to get the iPhone 14 Pro in the first place.

The hole is being converted into a completely new experience by Apple and works like this:

Under the name “Dynamic Island,” Apple has rethought its punchhole into a display center. If you start a song, let a timer count down or connect your Airpods, the hole visually expands to the side and shows the notifications for it inside of the now larger black frame.
This not only looks cool, but actually offers added value. If you tap on the song display, for example, the black area of ​​the island expands even further. Song titles then also appear, the option to continue or skip back as well as a slider for jumping in the song. Unlocking apps via FaceID, the display when a charger has been connected and much more are now all part of the new display.
In the future, many well-known apps will also support “Dynamic Island” and the added value will therefore continue to increase.

Of course there is an upgrade for the camera again this year. Up to 4x higher resolution in ProRAW and a larger sensor than the iPhone 13 Pro.
Of course, with the new A16 Bionic chip, it's not just the hardware that gets more out of the images, but also the software. For example, you can use TrueDepth to focus on multiple subjects in photos and selfies, and with Action mode you no longer need a gimbal to get good shots in turbulent and dynamic shots.
The photos at night, whether with or without flash, have also become significantly sharper and better.
Of course, I could continue to bore you with all the technical details, but anyone who is seriously interested can find these details on Apple's product page.
It should be enough here that not only Apple's marketing department praises the new camera but I can also definitely confirm the improvement in practice.

► 🔌 Battery life: is the always-on display noticeable? 🔌

We already know the always-on display from the Apple Watch and now the iPhone 14 Pro gets it too. Apple has again installed a lot of software solutions to still save battery power. This means the iPhone recognizes whether it is in your pocket or whether you are in the room and can optionally switch off the display completely if you cannot look at it anyway.
With normal everyday use, the battery lasts me from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. and I still have around 25% in the evening, which means that the iPhone then goes to the MagSafe charging cable.

👉 Another little tip to preserve the battery capacity for as long as possible☝️

A lithium-ion battery is best charged between 20-80%. Since this is not so easy to do in everyday life, there is a simple trick to not charge the device to more than 80%.
The keyword here is a shortcut app in combination with a smart socket. The shortcuts app then sends a signal to the smart socket that it should switch off at 80%.
Nils-Hendrik Welk has summarized how the whole thing works in a YouTube video and this makes it possible to maintain the maximum capacity of your iPhone battery for significantly longer.
By the way: The whole thing also works with smart sockets from the SmartLife app: Simply create one for switching the socket on and one for switching off the socket under scene and create a shortcut for Siri (add to Siri at the bottom right) and then in the shortcuts app Set up automation as shown in the video but instead set up the shortcut for the socket on and the shortcut for the socket off. This saves you a HomeKit-compatible socket if you currently only use SmartLife

►🚦 Advantages and disadvantages 🚦

✅ a variety of new possibilities through Dynamic Island
✅ The German market still has a SIM card slot (only the US market has been completely converted to eSim)
✅ A16 Bionic sets new standards
✅ Significantly improved photo and video recordings
✅ New action mode ensures almost blur-free videos even without a gimbal
✅ Battery lasts despite the new always-on display all day long
✅ CrashDetect feature detects car accidents and automatically calls for help (especially useful for older cars without eCall function)
✅ magnificent display with up to 2000 nits brightness and therefore no more problems even in direct sunlight
✅ again improved macro photography through a better proximity sensor
❌ still no USB-C charging port (the new EU standard would slowly have to force Apple to switch to USB-C)
❌ Camera system protrudes very far from the housing and without a protective cover you scratch the lenses
❌ ProRes 4K only available from the 256 GB version
❌ steep storage charges and generally due to the weak euro, the iPhone has become even more expensive this year

► 🤔 Who is the upgrade worth it for? 🫣

Generally speaking, for everyone who doesn't have an iPhone 13 Pro/Max and anyone who has an iPhone 13 Pro/Max and has the necessary change will definitely be satisfied with the new iPhone 14 Pro.

➡️ Conclusion

The iPhone Pro will once again be a bestseller and most buyers will pay the extra price on the Pro version simply because of Dynamic Island.
The Ultra in Apple's advertising text is also a hidden reference to the next few years. Apple has shown the way with the Apple Watch Ultra and will most likely offer an iPhone Ultra with more features in addition to the normal iPhone, iPhone Plus, iPhone Pro and Max in the future to make the highest version attractive to customers.
Personally, I am very satisfied with my iPhone 14 Pro and the innovations have definitely convinced me.

Buy recommendation? 👍

I hope that I was able to help you a little with my review. Thank you!Some time ago it was that time again. It was time for a new cell phone.
Since my sister has been using Apple iPhones for a long time, I thought it was time for me to buy an Apple iPhone too.
After some research, I decided on the iPhone 14 Pro.
I ordered the black iPhone with a storage capacity of 512 GB.
The scope of delivery included both the iPhone and a USB-C to Lightning cable. At first I was a little worried that it would be difficult to transfer the data from my Android phone to the Apple iPhone.
But there is a great app with which I could easily transfer all important data, including photos and videos, to my iPhone.
I chose this model because I do a lot of sports outside.
I often travel in the mountains and sometimes completely alone.
With my old cell phone, I sometimes had no reception there and was always afraid that something would happen to me and I wouldn't be able to get help.
But with my new iPhone I have the certainty that I can make an emergency call via satellite. I could write a text message and send it even if I don't have a network. Furthermore, this cell phone also detects if I ever have a serious car accident and am no longer able to call emergency services myself.
Luckily it is also protected from splash water and dust and I could even dive six meters deep for half an hour. (Maybe I'll do that next summer.)
I now use the iPhone a lot at home when I'm working in the kitchen or doing other housework, because films play back very well.
I can watch videos for up to 23 hours without having to recharge my phone.
So far I haven't had any problems with my new cell phone, but if necessary, there is 24/7 technical support that can help me with any questions.
In addition, a repair service in the event of accidental damage is included in the price.
Now some technical data: the dimensions are 0.78 x 7.15 x 14.75 cm and the iPhone 14 pro weighs 206 grams.
Of course you can use all mobile phone operators and if 5G mobile phone technology is available, this can also be used.
The operating system is iOS 16 and the connection is a USB Type C.
The cell phone has a 48 MP main camera with four times higher resolution. Personally, I'm quite happy with the cameras, which is why I give them a full star rating.
But all in all, I'm very happy and don't regret switching from an Android to this Apple iPhone 14 Pro.
Sometimes I film on my mountain tours and when I show the films to others, they are always very impressed by how smooth the recordings are.

In addition, the speakers are very good and have a very good sound!

There is a star deduction because the price is simply far too expensive.

Finally, I would like to say once again that I think it is very good that Apple wants to develop and produce its products CO2-neutrally by 2030.
It feels good to be committed to protecting the environment.
Because everyone needs a good cell phone these days!I recently purchased the Apple iPhone 14 Pro in the 128 GB version in gold and I am simply thrilled with this smartphone. As a long-time Android user, switching to iOS was a decision I don't regret. The iPhone 14 Pro offers an impressive camera, numerous features and a seamless experience.

When it comes to features, the iPhone 14 Pro offers a variety of options that will delight users. From facial recognition with Face ID to support for augmented reality to seamless integration with other Apple devices, this smartphone offers a wealth of features that make everyday life easier. The performance of the A15 Bionic chip is particularly impressive, ensuring fast and smooth operation.

Switching from Android to iOS was easier than expected. Apple has made the switch easier with the “Move to iOS” app, which makes it possible to transfer data such as contacts, photos and messages from the old Android smartphone to the new iPhone. Within minutes, all of my important data was available on iPhone 14 Pro and I was able to continue working seamlessly.

The design of the iPhone 14 Pro is elegant and attractive. The gold finish gives the device a luxurious touch and the build quality is top notch. The display is vibrant and offers a high refresh rate thanks to ProMotion technology, resulting in a smooth and pleasant user experience.

In summary, I can say that the Apple iPhone 14 Pro in the 128 GB Gold version is an outstanding smartphone. The camera is top-notch, the features are varied, and switching from Android to iOS was effortless. If you are looking for a powerful and easy-to-use smartphone, the iPhone 14 Pro is definitely a top choice.Apple's iPhone 14 Pro sets new standards in camera quality and exceeds the expectations of even the most demanding photographers. With an impressive combination of advanced technology and innovative features, this smartphone offers outstanding image quality that impresses in every situation.

The main camera of the iPhone 14 Pro has a high-resolution sensor that captures the finest details and delivers razor-sharp images. Color reproduction is vibrant and accurate, while the dynamic range is extended to deliver impressive contrast in both bright and dark areas.

A notable feature of the iPhone 14 Pro is the advanced Night Mode. Thanks to improved low-light capabilities, exceptional shots can be captured even in low light. The camera automatically adjusts to lighting conditions and reduces image noise to ensure clear and detailed photos. This is ideal for shooting at dusk, indoors or in dark environments.

The iPhone 14 Pro's telephoto camera offers impressive zoom capabilities. With optical magnification and advanced image stabilization, distant subjects can be captured precisely and without loss of quality. Whether you're taking landscape photos, portraits or photographing details, the iPhone 14 Pro's zoom opens up new creative possibilities.

For all portrait photography enthusiasts, the iPhone 14 Pro offers professional depth of field control. With portrait mode, backgrounds can be specifically blurred and the focus can be placed on the main subject. The results are impressive and give the recordings an impressive depth effect.

In addition to still images, the iPhone 14 Pro also offers notable video capabilities. With 4K recording quality, optical image stabilization and improved HDR, it delivers smooth and detailed cinema-quality videos. Dolby Vision support enables expanded color reproduction and dynamics for an immersive movie experience.

The iPhone 14 Pro's camera app also offers an intuitive user interface and numerous manual setting options. Photographers can customize their shots according to their individual preferences and fully exploit their creativity.

Apple's iPhone 14 Pro is undoubtedly an impressive smartphone with camera quality that will delight even professional photographers. With its advanced technology, wide range of features and premium image quality, it is an outstanding choice for anyone looking to take their photography skills to the next level.Got it on Prime Day.
What else is there to say about the iPhone?
For me it is the successor to the 12. The 14 is of course faster and the battery is better too. The camera has made a big leap in my opinion and takes very good photos/videos.
The only drawback is the lack of a power supply and that you need one with USB-C.I've always had an iPhone. Now it's time for a new one.
I'm very satisfied
with the fast delivery. I had the 11 Pro for years before that.
This was one of Apple's first Pro models.
The battery gave me problems after a few months and this gives me a good comparison to the iPhone 14 Pro.
I chose the 256 GB version because there is a better camera (4K).
The battery doesn't cause any problems at all and the processor is pretty fast.
The iPhone feels high quality and good quality.
I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for an iPhone that is durable and can also record good videos 👌Great phone because it's easy to understand and everything works perfectly. Already my fourth iPhone highly recommended.Great phone with great features and great camera.The iPhone 14 pro does everything it promises. I can only recommend it, especially if you are traveling in the Apple cosmos. Everyone works together perfectly.What can I say about an iPhone other than the fact that it is an iPhone ;)
See for yourself the great camera, the quick operation and response and the great design.

After much consideration, I decided to upgrade from the 8 plus and am more than satisfied.

The delivery came on the promised day, the messenger asked for the code, which you receive in advance by email or app, and when we handed it over we checked together whether the contents were correct. Personally, I think it's a good thing if you keep the value of the device in mind.Compared to the iPhone SE 2016, the jump is huge! Finally the 14 Pro got a reasonable camera resolution. In seven years my eyesight has deteriorated, and the brilliant display satisfactorily compensates for the weakness. The battery charging management works perfectly; when the temperature increases at a defined level, charging is interrupted to protect the iPhone from overheating. Bravo. For a connection in the e-car “Apple Car Play”, the necessary permanent connection is constantly under control. The Apple Maps app also got bike navigation. I will add experiences from time to time. So far the review is a snapshot....had an iPhone 7 since 2017, so it was time for something new. It's a huge difference. At first I had problems paying via FaceID, and based on the entries online, I was probably not the only one. But that's the only thing I have to complain about. Apple's documentation could be better.
I finally got it done and initially found it a bit more complicated than using TouchID. But now it works just as quickly as with the old 7-series - it's probably a matter of habit.
But that doesn't change my opinion of the 14 Pro: it's a great part!E fulfills my wishes. By far the best I've had so far. I can only recommend.I had to buy a new cell phone because my old one suddenly wouldn't turn on. The iPhone is visually very beautiful and the cameras are absolutely convincing. - that was also the reason why I chose this iPhone (currently the latest model iPhone 14). Still very satisfied after four months of use. Battery capacity is still at 100% even though I often use it in the background (podcast, audio books,…).I have to say, I am not happy with the iPhone 14 Pro, not in any way. First of all, the apps don't work smoothly and the phone often crashes. It is slow in many areas and gets stuck or hangs very often. It also gets warm and hot very quickly, whether with or without a cover. Even when charging, the process is interrupted occasionally because the cell phone has apparently become too hot. I've never had this happen on an iPhone before. If I want to charge a cell phone, I do so because I need a battery and the process should not be interrupted by alleged overheating, otherwise I suspect something is wrong with the charging function or the battery. At least it can't be due to the charging cable or the induction. They also worked on the other iPhones, whether 13 or 13. The camera should take much better pictures, but it doesn't! Many images are blurry. I have to say the camera is even worse than the iPhone 12 mini or iPhone X. Completely unacceptable! The sound, especially with audio messages like WhatsApp, is also seriously bad. Every now and then I receive messages that my voice messages can no longer be heard because they arrive completely unclear.
I've always bought directly from Apple or Telekom. Here I am assuming that old devices that have been in stock for a long time were sold for €200 cheaper. Or what I think is perhaps worse, they took returns that were sent back by customers after they were defective and sold them again as new cell phones. Whatever the case, stay away from these offers. I can only complain to Amazon and Mr. Bezo. This type of selling is not okay. I've always bought Apple cell phones since the beginning, but this is by far the worst cell phone I've had in my hand, even though it's supposed to be the most modern! Since I need the cell phone, it is of course difficult to send it back and then wait for a new one. Especially since I also painstakingly stuck a good tempered glass film over it. But I think I'll send it back because the quality is absolutely the lowest I've ever received from Apple. I have to say it's just annoying!

Addendum September 5, 2023:
The cell phone gets stuck and spins more and more. Crashes get stuck in the app. Speech and dictation functions are absolutely inadequate and always get stuck. Sometimes Siri or the system does not understand the language. It's just too stubborn. The disruptions in WhatsApp audio messages are becoming more and more annoying. You can hardly be heard from other contacts, only very quietly and then in very low tones with scratches and disturbing noises, wherever they come from. As Apple said before when it was presented, the camera isn't anywhere near perfect. Even my iPhone 12 mini takes far better pictures. I don't know whether it's the cell phone itself or because Amazon sells old or used cell phones here. But I will never buy a cell phone from Amazon again! Send me a new one from Mr. Amazon and Mr. Bezo and I will immediately send you this junk cell phone back. I can only really strongly advise against buying a cell phone here! The software for the Echo Show devices was also blatantly neglected, so I'll be jumping ship there too. What were these gentlemen in technology thinking! And then always these comments check your WLAN and reset the device to factory settings. WLAN is perfect. Factory settings have been made and replacement devices have already been requested. These guys in marketing must think we're completely stupid... man, really The software for the Echo Show devices was also blatantly neglected, so I'll be jumping ship there too.

5 people found this helpful. Do you need an iPhone that costs over 1200? Definitely no. But the elegant feel, the new functions, the better camera and longer battery life made me buy the iPhone 14 Pro and I don't regret it.I'm back from Android. And I haven't regretted it so far. Great quality, well made. Great display. Operating system has a hand and foot. It's just fun. Whether Android or Apple both have their advantages.I ordered the cell phone on Wednesday, it said it would arrive on Saturday, but I was able to pick it up on Friday from the pickup point near me. I read here that somehow people don't get cell phones but get some other things instead and I was scared. My order was inside and looked new and beautiful. Transferring files from the old phone took a while (I had way too many photos and videos), but it worked perfectly. Very easy. The first impression was that it wasn't much different from iPhone 11 (for the price) but over time I noticed the difference and I'm very satisfied. Let's see how it goes.Currently the best smartphone on the market for me. Equipment, quality.Everything worked out great. Was a little worried, but there were no problems.
I think cell phones are ok too 👌I'm happy, it's clear that it's annoying that Apple thinks we're stupid and now, even with higher prices for the device, the accessories have to be paid extra - I'd rather not be annoyed by Apple anymore - but I don't like Android. I want to have twice as much🥰I always had Samsung or Huawei, but am now a die-hard Apple lover, even if these high-end smartphones are always far too expensive. Before that, I had my (first) iPhone 12 mini for almost 2 years and found the performance to be very good. The 14 Pro logically beats the 12 mini by far. Ps: never again without Face ID :-)What should I write here? Apple iPhone is always great Great quality as always It's good price and device. My sister very happy and satisfied with her new device.. thank you for Amazon on time delivery..
Thank you..I'm super at peace First of all, the design of the iPhone 14 Pro is stunning. It is slim and elegant and feels very high quality. The screen is large and crisp, making watching movies and browsing websites a real pleasure.

The iPhone 14 Pro's camera is simply incredible. It offers outstanding image quality and ensures that every shot looks sharp and vibrant. I was particularly impressed by the camera's low-light function, which allowed me to capture clear and detailed images even in low-light conditions.

The speed of the iPhone 14 Pro is also remarkable. Apps open immediately and respond to input quickly. This makes using the device very pleasant and quick.

Additionally, the battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro is very impressive. I can use it all day without having to charge it, which is very convenient for me.

In summary, I can say that the iPhone 14 Pro is an amazing device that is worth its price. It has an impressive design, an outstanding camera, fast speed and long battery life. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a high-end smartphone that has everything.Hello,
ordered and received!
What else can you say about that?
iPhone stop :*Chic, fast, great camera Delivered quickly as always with Amazon,
I'm very happy with the product
and it was cheap too so thumbs up Coming from the iPhone 8 Plus:
So for a while now I had been putting off an upgrade from my previous iPhone. Various life reasons, costs, priorities, etc.
Well finally I had enough as my Iphone 8 no longer worked for NFC, dropped playback of music streaming, etc. Yes it had a few drops over the years so I give it the benefit of the doubt.

So new phone should offer better pictures and it does exceptionally. Often I find the best camera is the one that is on you to capture those surprise or special moments. As I move forward in life I have noticed having very specific tools for things often become the focus of the even them selves and miss the whole other aspect of life called "living life". When a technology gets in the way of this (carrying my DSLR), listening on wired headphones, switching devices for a call, paying bills and carrying a big wallet to get out cards, etc.

Apple has nailed it again but in a subtle way that many will miss the point on. Sure there are better phones with cameras, more customization freedom, and some other things. What they all miss is the seamless integration and blending into the background of life and enhancing the normal what we do.

Camera is pretty awesome and I have made some great prints using this in RAW format, especially over the 8 generation. NFC of course it works and also with my apple Watch. Streaming with airplay great, screen is a huge improvement, and now using Face ID instead of touch ID is in every way better so far.
Always on display is also nice and the maglev fast charging.

Costs!!
Well as a longer term investment it is still a luxury and there is no way getting around that. But if experience is any indication hopefully it becomes worth it. No I am not a fan boy but I paid for this and now I will just get on with living life and have this enhance those certain aspects it fits into.

I would highly recommend getting a case and insurance.Battery lasts a long time The price was very good on Amazon. It's a top cell phone 👍
Great condition and good delivery All I can say is WOW.
This is absolutely the best cell phone I've had so far.

At the beginning I was a bit skeptical about the pill notch / dynamic island and always-on display.

It took me a good 2 weeks to get used to it. But now I don't want to be without the device anymore.

- Dynamic Island is a lot of fun and makes things easier.

- Always-on display is now very easy to set. That's very very good.
I used to constantly tap the display to check for new notifications. This is no longer necessary and makes life a little easier again.

- As far as the cameras are concerned, absolutely great. Since I have the 1TB version, storage space doesn't matter and I shoot everything in RAW at maximum resolution. You can then easily adjust the colors of the images and whatever else is necessary. And you have top sharpness.

- The battery is better than its predecessors. Despite the always-on display, I have good reserves here.

- The display is absolutely the best you can have in terms of brightness (I permanently set it to 80% in the operating aids, otherwise it would be too high), color, brilliance and speed.

- The sound has also increased. Apple can absolutely score points here and it sounds very good both on the ear and on the speaker.

- Satellite SOS also works very well in Germany. If there is no network at all (yes, that is still normal in Germany), it immediately indicates the possibility of using the satellites.

- Design is very nice, I have the black model. That's very nice, but I often use it with the Apple leather case because I'm sometimes very stupid and afraid that it will fall out of my hand onto stone or concrete or asphalt and then the beauty will be gone.

- Another thing I forgot, the cell phone reception is better than its predecessors.

Now I have written so much and I hope I was able to get people excited about the device despite the high price.

PS sometimes there are also warehouse items, which are usually almost unused and you save some money.An iPhone, mega camera, otherwise as usual But it was resolved after a few phone calls and emails and I received the money back. In the second attempt the iPhone arrived and I am very happy with the device!

I can only recommend that everyone always take pictures/videos when unpacking. This is the only way to prove that there really wasn't an iPhone in the package. Luckily I was able to do that.It does everything an iPhone promises and more. Excellent smartphone!!!!Apple Store'da 1300€ olan bu cihaz Amazon 1089€ idi. Forget about 914€'ya alma almış oldum. Cihaz çift hatlı, birisi fiziksel SIM, diğeri ise eSIM. Teslimat tam zamanında yapıldı.Perfect I was eagerly waiting to see my iPhone. It is delivered on time and packaging was good. Camera was awesome and I'm already in love with my phone Technically great The iPhone 14 Pro pleasantly surprised me and I would like to share my experience. The design of the device is attractive and the workmanship is high quality. It fits well in the hand and conveys a feeling of quality.

The iPhone 14 Pro's display is impressive. The colors are vibrant and the details are crisp. It offers a premium visual experience when watching videos, viewing photos and using apps.

The performance of the iPhone 14 Pro is remarkable. It works quickly and efficiently no matter what tasks I'm doing. Apps open quickly and multitasking works smoothly. Even graphics-intensive games run smoothly.

The iPhone 14 Pro's camera delivers impressive results. The images are of high quality and the camera performs well even in difficult lighting conditions.

In addition, the iPhone 14 Pro offers practical functions such as reliable facial recognition and a solid battery life that accompany me throughout the day.

All in all, the iPhone 14 Pro exceeded my expectations and impressed me in many ways.We ordered new iPhones and are as satisfied as we have been for years. There isn't that much to say either. Once an Apple always an iPhone.
And the camera is just really good! Was there quickly. There were no problems.Great IPHONE! Everything worked perfectly, fast delivery.One of the best products from apple and very good in use.Mega good cell phone!! We recommend !!Nice phone, great camera and everything else is great .A delicacy among smartphones. Intuitive and reliable functionality. Great pictures. Unfortunately quite heavy - but so much power also has weight...At the time of purchase, the device was €150 cheaper than all other retailers I am really satisfied with iphone 14 pro. Everything was I expected. Only problem I had was shipping because my first order probably lost in shipping process and I requested customer service to replace my order. Today, finally the phone arrived. All process took approximately 1.5 weeks. I recommend.Good and expensive I ordered the iPhone and am very satisfied so far. I know both operating systems Android and iOS and have always swapped between Samsung and Apple. I like both, but this time the iPhone appealed to me again and I have to say the processing of the system is great. Unfortunately the prices are just a thing. Otherwise, I can recommend this smartphone to anyone who doesn't need a lot of bells and whistles but wants a good, fast operating system and the resale value doesn't drop so quickly.Good product, product as pictured As usual with Apple, it's well made.
Great camera.
Runs easily without any dropouts or hang-ups.
The price is already very high (actually too high).
However, you also get an absolute premium product.I previously had an iPhone Xs in silver with 512GB. I no longer wanted to miss the luxury of the large storage space. This is now my third iPhone. I had the 3G, which I didn't like at the time and made me switch to Android. The Xs converted me and after almost 4 years I was ready to switch to the 14 Pro.

Display:
The display is significantly more intense and brighter than my previous one. The 120hz is noticeable and pleasantly fluid. But there is not such a big jump here. Nevertheless, it is one of the best displays on the market in terms of quality.
I think the Dynamic Island is very cleverly integrated and I use it extensively.

Battery pack:
My Xs only had 80% left and therefore the battery is a new world for me. The phone now lasts through the day again and even more. Excellent! I use MagSafe to charge and it works great. I have the black leather case and charging works without any problems here too.

Performance:
Honestly... I don't feel it. Some apps start significantly faster, yes. The rest is unnoticeable. The difference between 4G and 5G is hardly worth mentioning in my usage profile. Here and there apps open faster and some applications run more smoothly.

Optics:
Yes, killer feature for me. That black, that satin back... A dream! It also feels excellent. It's a shame that there has to be a cover around it. However, it is still very slippery and the phone should be easy to hold in your hand. The protruding cameras are of course intense and I hope Apple has now reached its limit here.

Camera:
Another feature that made the change necessary for me. A lot has happened, especially when taking night photos my Xs completely stinks. Portrait photos are even better worked out. Differences are only marginal when taking photos in bright surroundings. The better front camera is a small gain if you use it for selfies.

Price:
Yes, that was really a shock. I'm not a fan of financing or contract phones. That's why I save the money and buy the phone. At this high price, deducting money from your account hurts. Inflation and the euro exchange rate, okay. But the price has reached a limit for me. Sure, at some point I would have the option of not choosing the largest or second largest storage option.

Conclusion:
Free of fanboy chatter, the iPhones are good phones. I'm happy because I haven't been disappointed so far. The price is shocking but in the end the phone has developed well. Hopefully in 4 years I will still be just as satisfied.I've been there since the company's Blackberry was replaced with an iPhone over 10 years ago. It was still a 4 back then. Once over the years I had an Android device from a well-known brand with S at the beginning, scary, sold it after a few weeks and finally got another Apple device. Quality has its price. Now a 12 Pro was recently replaced by this one, it was a warehouse deal in “very good”, couldn’t see any difference to a classic new one, except that the price was better. Recommended!I was happy to be able to save a few euros and also that it could be delivered so quickly! I also really like the transfer with password and it worked perfectly. I am very satisfied with the features of the iPhone 14 Pro. However, the battery lasts shorter than expected (my iPhone 11 initially lasted for two days, the iPhone 14 pro now “only” 1 1/2).
I definitely recommend protection for the outside camera because it stands out so much and is therefore faster can be damaged The camera is simply unbeatable.
I'm very happy with the battery life and it feels great in the hand. After a good 13 years in the Android smartphone world (the last iPhone was a 3GS), recent disappointments with the OnePlus 9 Pro (great hardware, less optimized and buggy software) meant it was time for a second attempt.

At that time, people tried everything to personalize their iPhone a little more and to get around the restrictions imposed by Apple... a few years later, people are a little less playful and more willing to compromise.

My opinion so far after almost a week of use:

(-) Apple is sticking to many limitations (e.g. regarding data exchange via USB/Bluetooth/WiFi-Direct outside the Apple ecosystem as well as various display settings - home screen - no customizable grid / alternative launchers etc.)

(-) Pricing - the prices themselves are steep, the surcharges for more memory, which cannot be expanded afterwards, are cheeky and the fact that, for example, the ProRes function can only be used with 256 GB, but for entry-level devices it is 128 GB starts bordering on mockery.

(+) Form factor - with its 6.1 inches, the 14 Pro is still just as handy and fits much better in your pocket than, for example, a 6.7 inch device - and that as a flagship model.

(+) Software/sustainability - long-term system updates - Apple is unbeaten in this regard - exemplary.

(+) Battery - despite the lower capacity (3,200mAh) compared to In the case of the OnePlus 9pro (4,500mAh), the battery of the iPhone lasts at least as well, if not longer (both with activated Always On Display - variable refresh rate up to 120Hz) - the impression here is actually that the newer Android battery generation Not only does it charge super quickly (100% in 30 minutes - 65 watts) but unfortunately it also discharges faster. This striking difference is probably due to the fact that Apple not only designed the processor itself, but has also been meticulously working on the software for years and optimizing it for a comparatively manageable number of devices (compared to the Android world).

(+) Screen / Dynamic Island / AlwaysOnDisplay - great screen - great colors, fantastic maximum brightness and the integration of the cutouts for the front camera and sensors is, in typical Apple style, well done. The interpretation of the AOD is good, but leaves some wishes unfulfilled in terms of its adaptability - for example, a purely black background regardless of the background image / changing the brightness value / time window for active AOD etc. .

Overall, a really great device and recommended for anyone who has a lot of money - despite the noticeable limitations that still exist. However, you have to be aware of the Android world.all the best, thank you. As usual, the product was installed quickly and easily. There is nothing more to report yet.a great smartphone. Can do everything - has everything. The only thing that has annoyed me for decades is the weight of these things!Everything went smoothly, ordered, delivered and have been happily using the cell phone ever since I am perfectly happy. Once an iPhone, always an iPhone My old phone was 7plus (128gb). I have uploaded my phone directly from icloud and it was completely uploaded. That's why I couldn't have the feeling of a new phone.
I am disappointed about the camera because of my higher expectations. Although I have a very old iPhone, I can get similar photos under good light conditions. There may be some update for the photo improvements.

The battery life is amazing, I can use almost 2 days without charging with very active usage.

The delivery was perfect, and the price was very competitive. Thank you Amazon!My old phone was 7plus (128gb). I have uploaded my phone directly from icloud and it was completely uploaded. That's why I couldn't have the feeling of a new phone.

The delivery was perfect, and the price was very competitive. Thank you Amazon!As expected, a great, no, a perfect cell phone!Everything fits :) came from the Amazon warehouse, but had no signs of wear, condition “very good” I don't regret the change. The battery on my 13 Pro had somehow gotten worse and the price for the 14 Pro was significantly lower than Apple's, so I took it.

The Always on Display - nice to have but not a selling point for me.

Dynamic Island - see above - nice to look at but not a killer feature.

The display is much brighter outside in the sunshine and therefore easier to read - that's another argument.

Video recordings/image stabilization - great thing - already used eagerly.

Would I upgrade again (after 1.5 years) - to a limited extent yes.

The camera and display are great, and the SOS function via satellite is also good if you travel a lot by bike. However, the price quoted by Apple is too expensive and does not justify switching from the 13 Pro Ordered and already there.I've had it for about a week now... everything seems to be working perfectly so far 🙂Fully meets my expectations. Great camera and lightning-fast processor.Battery life good Camera like a SLR camera and even better! Fast delivery works!Expensive device but really good quality from Apple.The iPhone 14 pro was purchased as the successor to the one-year-old iPhone 13 Pro Max and is performing as expected.
An iPhone is great.

My first iPhone was the 8, then the 11 pro, 12 pro, 13 pro max and finally the 14 pro.
Before that I had two Androids, and before that various Blackberries.
I "loved" them all... except the Androids, I couldn't warm up to them, which is why the iPhone as such was the logical consequence and still is to this day.

That's just backstory.
Of course, the newer iPhone was always the better, at least in some respects.
None would have been necessary! Well, maybe the 11pro, because after the 8 it used the entire screen.
Of course, the camera has always gotten a little better and since these days you only look at the photos on your cell phone or tablet, it's no longer worth digging out the much higher quality DSLR or system camera, you just use your smartphone to take photos anyway.

In this respect, you can't go wrong with the iPhone.
Presumably similarly expensive Androids can't do anything else, like the iPhone.
I don't care about the notch, whether it's big or small, or currently the dynamic island, they don't bother me. Anyone who is bothered by this will get annoyed by it and generally have to keep their hands off the iPhone!

If you have at least €1,300 lying around unnecessarily, you can buy the iPhone 14 pro without hesitation.
But if you have to watch your money and have an almost current Pro model (12, 13) and are generally very satisfied with your photos, it would be better for sensible reasons to refrain from buying it and wait another year.

Although I was always happy about my new iPhone, the first thought after transferring the data and switching it on for the first time was always: Great, it's just like the old one and the money is gone for now!
The only real argument for the annual iPhone upgrade is the “I want it!” thought, there can certainly be no question of a necessity.It is an item taken for a gift to my daughter and my daughter is very happy.Arrived quickly at a great price. Exactly as ordered Top device I ordered the iPhone 14 Pro because I actually thought that the device was a really good purchase.

I previously used an iPhone 13 Pro. It now had a battery capacity of 90%. But the battery was still really good. I could get away with it all day. Of course the battery has become worse than when it was new, but when I used the 14 Pro in everyday life in the same way as the 13 Pro, I was a little irritated.

The performance, the design and everything that goes with it is of course really great. I also really like the Dynamic Island.

But the battery was a real problem for me.
Because it lasted noticeably worse in everyday life (despite 100% maximum capacity) than my 13 Pro with 90% maximum capacity.

I especially find the comparison between the battery of the 13 Pro when I bought it new to be harsh. You could have easily gotten away with that for two days. I can't even do a whole one with the 14 Pro. If I unplug the iPhone at 6:30 a.m., the battery is already at 12% at 7 p.m. with almost 4.5 hours of screen time.

That's a real disappointment and just not right for the price. Therefore, I am returning the product and sticking with my 13 Pro. Maybe I'll upgrade to the 15 Pro if that's worth it.

In and of itself, the iPhone 14 Pro is of course a great iPhone. It's worth it for anyone switching from older models, but I can actually only advise against it for anyone using a 13 Pro.Excellent What I love most is the camera because I'm constantly taking photos and videos, especially of my four-legged friends.
The quality is simply fantastic.
Otherwise everything runs extremely smoothly, the color (dark purple) is really chic.
I'm thrilled 🤩Visually the device looks awesome and as a new phone it's pretty good. In my opinion, it's not worth switching from the iPhone 11 upwards because the cell phone is really expensive and it gets small scratches pretty quickly, which is of course very annoying. Overall a solid 4/5 I'm pretty satisfied.
(Switching from iPhone 12 to 14 Pro)Simply perfect, great phone For the production of the Apple product, the product is ok.Best cell phone, except for the price and the device itself Cell phone as always, iPhone is the best on the market in my opinion, but the battery could slowly get better Quality Apple - simply TOP!!!High quality workmanship and also feels very good. Fast. Good camera. FaceID works great.Charging status did not surprise as classic apple not very satisfying but overall nice dynamic island for an iphone has been very nice iphone quality is fabulous 🏻 many thanks to amazon 🏻
